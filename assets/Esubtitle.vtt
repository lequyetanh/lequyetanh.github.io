1
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.120
When I was lying there in the VA hospital.

2
00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.120
with a big hole blown through the middle of my life.

3
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.420
I started having these dreams of flying.

4
00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.250
I was free.

5
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.050
Sooner or later. though. you always have to wake up.

6
00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.770
They can fix a spinal. if you got the money.

7
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.610
but not on vet benefits. not in this economy.

8
00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.820
A VA check and 12 bucks will get you a cup of coffee.

9
00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.660
I'm what they call... waitlisted.

10
00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.210
The Bengal Tiger. extinct for over a century is making a comeback.

11
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.550
These cloned tiger cubs at the Beijing Zoo are the latest of a number of species

12
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.470
that have been cloned back into existence in the past five years.

13
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:47.770
I became a marine for the hardship. To be hammered on the anvil of life.

14
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.480
I told myself I can pass any test a man can pass.

15
00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.820
Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake!

16
00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.660
Let's get it straight. upfront.

17
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.160
I don't want your pity.

18
00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.420
You want a fair deal. you're on the wrong planet.

19
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.840
The strong prey on the weak.

20
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.260
That's just the way things are.

21
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.640
And nobody does a damn thing.

22
00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.160
Get off! Get off of him!

23
00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.410
All I ever wanted in my sorry-ass life was a single thing worth fighting for.

24
00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.600
I hope you realized you just lost yourself a customer.

25
00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.350
Candy-ass bitch.

26
00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.730
If it ain't raining. we ain't training.

27
00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.790
- It doesn't look like him.
- It's him.

28
00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.120
You Jake Sully?

29
00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:35.460
Step off. You're ruining my good mood.

30
00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:37.500
It's about your brother.

31
00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.760
We're looking for Sully. T.

32
00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:49.770
In there.

33
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.460
Jesus. Tommy.

34
00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:17.670
The strong prey on the weak.

35
00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.920
A guy with a knife took all Tommy would ever be

36
00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.590
for the paper in his wallet.

37
00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.760
The concern of the suits was touching.

38
00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.350
Your brother represented a significant investment.

39
00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.890
We'd like to talk to you about taking over his contract.

40
00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.440
And since your genome is identical to his. you could step into his shoes.

41
00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.020
so to speak.

42
00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.740
It'd be a fresh start on a new world.

43
00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.700
You could do something important. You can make a difference.

44
00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.870
And the pay is good.

45
00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:57.500
Very good.

46
00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.630
Tommy was the scientist. not me.

47
00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.710
He was the one who wanted to get shot light-years out in space

48
00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.090
to find the answers.

49
00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.890
Me. I was just another dumb grunt getting sent someplace he was gonna regret.

50
00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:47.840
In cryo. you don't dream at all.

51
00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.050
It doesn't feel like six years.

52
00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.430
More like a fifth of tequila and an ass-kicking.

53
00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.110
Are we there yet?

54
00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.450
Yeah. we're there. sunshine.

55
00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:13.370
We're there.

56
00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:17.620
You've been in cryo for five years. nine months and 22 days.

57
00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:20.500
You will be hungry. You will be weak.

58
00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:25.670
If you feel nausea. please use the sacks provided for your convenience.

59
00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:28.970
The staff thanks you in advance.

60
00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.650
Up ahead was Pandora.

61
00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:49.990
You grew up hearing about it. but I never figured I'd be going there.

62
00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:11.760
Valkyrie 1-6. copy...

63
00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:15.600
Valkyrie 1-6. you are clear for de-orbit burn at 2-2-4-niner.

64
00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:20.180
Copy. Venture Star. Go for de-orbit burn at 2-2-4-niner.

65
00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:42.660
- Exo-packs on! Let's go! Exo-packs on!
- Exo-packs on! Let's go!

66
00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:44.080
Remember. people. you lose that mask.

67
00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:47.880
you're unconscious in 20 seconds. you're dead in four minutes!

68
00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:51.260
Let's nobody be dead today! Looks very bad on my report.

69
00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:55.720
Hell's Gate tower. this is TAV 1-6 on approach.

70
00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.600
Crossing outer marker. Mine is in sight.

71
00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:42.390
Harnesses off! Get your packs!

72
00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:45.940
- Put it together. let's go! Let's go!
- Harnesses off! One minute!

73
00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:49.980
When that ramp comes down. go directly into the base. Do not stop!

74
00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:52.610
Go straight inside. Wait for my mark!

75
00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:02.990
Go. go. go. go! Get out of there! Keep moving! Let's go. let's go!

76
00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:15.170
There's no such thing as an ex-Marine.

77
00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:19.260
You may be out. but you never lose the attitude.

78
00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:32.820
Let's go. special case! Do not make me wait for you!

79
00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:34.650
Well. well. ladies.

80
00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:37.820
Look at all this fresh meat!

81
00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:47.830
Back on Earth. these guys were Army dogs. Marines.

82
00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:49.460
fighting for freedom.

83
00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:57.670
Look out. hot rod!

84
00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:01.010
But out here they're just hired guns.

85
00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:03.970
taking the money. working for the company.

86
00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:05.430
Check this out. man.

87
00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:07.520
Meals on wheels.

88
00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:11.730
Oh. man. that is just wrong.

89
00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:13.690
I got two guys free in about 20 minutes!

90
00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:15.320
Got it! Need them!

91
00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:26.870
You're not in Kansas anymore.

92
00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:33.210
You are on Pandora. ladies and gentlemen.

93
00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:37.050
Respect that fact every second of every day.

94
00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:40.930
If there is a hell.

95
00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:46.310
you might want to go there for some R&R after a tour on Pandora.

96
00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:49.310
Out there. beyond that fence.

97
00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:53.730
every living thing that crawls. flies or squats in the mud

98
00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:56.980
wants to kill you and eat your eyes for Jujubes.

99
00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:03.700
We have an indigenous population of humanoids called the Na'vi.

100
00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:06.080
They're fond of arrows dipped in a neurotoxin

101
00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:09.000
that'll stop your heart in one minute.

102
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.380
And they have bones reinforced with naturally occurring carbon fiber.

103
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.840
They are very hard to kill.

104
00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:21.300
As head of security. it is my job to keep you alive.

105
00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:25.010
I will not succeed.

106
00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:28.600
Not with all of you.

107
00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:31.730
If you wish to survive.

108
00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:34.690
you need to cultivate a strong mental attitude.

109
00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:37.690
You've got to obey the rules.

110
00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.490
Pandora rules.

111
00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:43.450
Rule number one...

112
00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:46.990
There's nothing like an old-school safety brief to put your mind at ease.

113
00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:54.870
Excuse me. Excuse me. Jake! You're Jake. right? Tom's brother.

114
00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:57.790
Wow! You look just like him.

115
00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:01.630
Sorry. I'm Norm. Spellman. I went through avatar training with him.

116
00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.720
...into the bio-lab.

117
00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:08.970
We're gonna spend a lot of time up here. Hey! How you doing? Norm. avatar driver.

118
00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:10.310
- Hi.
- Hey.

119
00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:11.980
Link... Here's the link room right here.

120
00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:14.350
This is where we're connecting to the avatar.

121
00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:18.270
Me and Norm are here to drive

122
00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:21.480
these remotely controlled bodies called avatars.

123
00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:26.570
And they're grown from human DNA mixed with the DNA of the natives.

124
00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:28.620
- Hey. Welcome.
- Hey.

125
00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:31.080
- Welcome to Pandora. Good to have you.
- Thanks.

126
00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:34.960
Damn! They got big.

127
00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:37.580
Yeah. they fully mature on the flight out.

128
00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:40.000
So the proprioceptive sims seem to work really well.

129
00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:41.960
Yeah. they've got great muscle tone.

130
00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:43.970
It'll take us a few hours to get them decanted.

131
00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:45.930
but you guys can take them out tomorrow.

132
00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:47.800
There's yours.

133
00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:51.140
Hey. Dr. Norm Spellman.

134
00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:54.060
- Dr. Max Patel. Great to meet you.
- Good to meet you. yeah.

135
00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:19.460
Looks like him.

136
00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:22.550
No. it looks like you.

137
00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:25.590
This is your avatar now. Jake.

138
00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:33.220
And the concept is that every driver is matched to his own avatar.

139
00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:36.100
so that their nervous systems are in tune.

140
00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:38.940
or something.

141
00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:44.690
Which is why they offered me the gig. because I can link with Tommy's avatar.

142
00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:47.610
which is insanely expensive.

143
00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:51.820
Is this right? I just say whatever to the video log?

144
00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:54.080
Yeah. we gotta get in the habit of documenting everything.

145
00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.200
You know. what we see. what we feel.

146
00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:59.000
- It's all part of the science.
- And good science is good observation.

147
00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:01.540
Plus it'll help to keep you sane for the next six years.

148
00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:04.380
All right. Whatever.

149
00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:08.010
So...

150
00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:10.510
Well. here I am.

151
00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:13.680
doing science.

152
00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:16.430
They're coming out!

153
00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:19.020
Attention. Drivers coming out of link.

154
00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:27.690
Oh. God.

155
00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:31.360
Where's the lab coat? Where's the lab coat?

156
00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:37.750
Who's got my goddamn cigarette? Guys! What's wrong with this picture?

157
00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:42.290
- Thank you!
- Grace Augustine is a legend.

158
00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:44.880
She's the head of the Avatar Program. She wrote the book.

159
00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:47.760
I mean. literally wrote the book on Pandoran botany.

160
00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:50.050
Well. that's 'cause she likes plants better than people.

161
00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:52.430
Here she is. Cinderella back from the ball.

162
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:56.220
Grace. I'd like you to meet Norm Spellman and Jake Sully.

163
00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:01.690
Norm. I hear good things about you. How's your Na'vi?

164
00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:04.980
May the All Mother...

165
00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:07.190
...smile upon our first meeting.

166
00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:10.400
Not bad. You sound a little formal.

167
00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:13.870
I studied for five years...

168
00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:15.950
...but there is much to learn.

169
00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:19.660
- Grace? This is Jake Sully.
- Ma'am.

170
00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:24.250
Yeah. yeah. I know who you are. and I don't need you. I need your brother.

171
00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:27.960
You know. the PhD who trained for three years for this mission?

172
00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:29.460
He's dead.

173
00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:32.510
I know it's a big inconvenience for everyone.

174
00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:36.930
- How much lab training have you had?
- I dissected a frog once.

175
00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:41.520
You see? You see? I mean. they're just pissing on us

176
00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.980
without even the courtesy of calling it rain.

177
00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:45.310
- I'm going to Selfridge.
- No. Grace.

178
00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:47.940
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- No. man. this is such bullshit!

179
00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:49.440
I'm gonna kick his corporate butt.

180
00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:52.400
He has no business sticking his nose in my department.

181
00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:57.240
Here tomorrow. 0800. Try and use big words.

182
00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:09.500
Scorpion Two-Hotel. Hell's Gate tower. You are cleared for south departure.

183
00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:12.380
Hover taxi. Delta runway. Squawk ident.

184
00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:19.470
- You see that?
- Yes. sir.

185
00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:21.640
No. you didn't. You were looking at the monitor.

186
00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:24.640
I love this putter. Ronnie! I love this putter.

187
00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:31.820
Parker. you know. I used to think it was benign neglect.

188
00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:34.860
but now I see that you're intentionally screwing me.

189
00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:38.450
Grace. you know. I enjoy our little talks.

190
00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:46.330
I need a researcher. Not some jarhead dropout.

191
00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:48.000
Well. actually. I thought we got lucky with him.

192
00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:49.670
- Lucky?
- Yeah.

193
00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:51.710
How is this in any way lucky?

194
00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:53.550
Lucky your guy had a twin brother.

195
00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:56.550
and lucky that brother wasn't some oral hygienist or something.

196
00:16:56.890 --> 00:16:58.550
A Marine we can use.

197
00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:00.560
I'm assigning him to your team as security escort.

198
00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:04.020
The last thing I need is another trigger-happy moron out there!

199
00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:06.060
Look. look. you're supposed to be winning the hearts

200
00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:07.190
and the minds of the natives.

201
00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:09.060
Isn't that the whole point of your little puppet show?

202
00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:10.690
If you look like them and you talk like them.

203
00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:12.400
then they'll start trusting us.

204
00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:14.530
We build them a school. we teach them English.

205
00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:16.570
but after. what. how many years?

206
00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:18.240
Relations with the indigenous are only getting worse.

207
00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:21.580
Yeah. that tends to happen when you use machine guns on them.

208
00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:23.700
Right. Come here.

209
00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:26.540
I can't... I can't...

210
00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:32.750
This is why we're here. Unobtanium.

211
00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:35.920
Because this little gray rock sells for 20 million a kilo.

212
00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:39.220
That's the only reason. It's what pays for the whole party.

213
00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:41.220
It's what pays for your science.

214
00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:45.770
Now. those savages are threatening our whole operation.

215
00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:47.100
we're on the brink of war.

216
00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:50.400
and you're supposed to be finding a diplomatic solution.

217
00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:53.940
So use what you've got. and get me some results.

218
00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:07.410
So. how much link time have you logged?

219
00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:11.130
- About 520 hours.
- That's good.

220
00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:15.510
You're in there. You're here. How much have you logged?

221
00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:18.260
Zip. But I read a manual.

222
00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:21.260
Tell me you're joking.

223
00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:23.970
This is cool.

224
00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:25.850
Let's go.

225
00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:31.480
Don't. I got this.

226
00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:38.490
So you just figured you'd come out here.

227
00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:41.110
to the most hostile environment known to man.

228
00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:44.950
with no training of any kind. and see how it went?

229
00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:47.370
What was going through your head?

230
00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:50.290
Maybe I was sick of doctors telling me what I couldn't do.

231
00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:53.670
- Biometrics are good.
- Link three is ready.

232
00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:58.420
Keep your arms in. hands in. head down.

233
00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:03.300
Down. Just relax and let your mind go blank.

234
00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:05.970
That shouldn't be hard for you.

235
00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:07.810
Kiss the darkest part of my lily white...

236
00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:09.350
Initiate link.

237
00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:12.690
Run sequence unit three. Go.

238
00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:14.150
Launching.

239
00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:21.070
I have the first congruency.

240
00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:35.040
- That's a gorgeous brain. Nice activity.
- Go figure.

241
00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:37.040
Phase-Iock 40%.

242
00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:42.590
All right. Going in.

243
00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:44.800
I'm going in in four.

244
00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:50.470
Phase-Iock 99%. Link is stable.

245
00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:11.250
He's in. Jake. can you hear me? Can you hear me. Jake?

246
00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:12.870
Pupillary reflex is good.

247
00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:18.670
Pinna response normal. How you feeling. Jake?

248
00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:20.760
Hey. guys.

249
00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:23.420
Welcome to your new body. Jake.

250
00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:24.880
Good!

251
00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:26.390
Yeah. we're gonna take this nice and easy. Jake.

252
00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:28.600
- And touch your thumb to your fingers.
- Yeah.

253
00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:30.060
- Thumb to your fingers.
- No problem.

254
00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:31.720
That's good. I can see you can remember that one.

255
00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:33.980
- Got it.
- Well. if you want to sit up.

256
00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:35.390
- that's fine.
- Okay. good. Just take it

257
00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:38.400
nice and slow. Jake. Good. Okay. well. no truncal ataxia. that's good.

258
00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:41.980
Are you feeling lightheaded or dizzy at all? You're wiggling your toes!

259
00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:43.820
- Good. Good. Jake.
- That's great.

260
00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:48.410
Distal motor control is good. Good. Jake.

261
00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:51.160
Are you feeling any numbness or pain?

262
00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:53.790
That's great. Jake. Hold on. now.

263
00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:56.120
Take it easy. Don't get ahead of yourself. okay?

264
00:20:56.210 --> 00:20:58.790
There's a few more sensory motor reflex tests we need to run.

265
00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:00.960
- so take it easy.
- Wait.

266
00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:02.460
- Jake.
- Sit down. Jake.

267
00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:04.920
Jake! Listen to me. Jake!

268
00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:07.260
- I need you to sit down. Jake!
- It's okay.

269
00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:09.140
- Buddy. listen to me.
- It's all good. I got this.

270
00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:12.930
- Jake. you need to sit down right now.
- Guys. get him back on the gurney now.

271
00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:15.140
Listen to me. For your own safety. you need to sit down.

272
00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:17.980
You need time to adjust to the avatar... Whoa! Jake!

273
00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:20.310
- God. Jake. watch your tail.
- Yeah!

274
00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:24.490
Sedate! Sedate him! A thousand milligrams of Supitocam! Stat!

275
00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:26.860
Guys! Guys! Whoa! Whoa!

276
00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:27.950
By the numbers.

277
00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:29.450
- Jake. Come on.
- Jake! Listen to me.

278
00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:31.120
You're not used to your avatar body.

279
00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:32.950
- This is dangerous.
- This is great.

280
00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:36.250
- Jake? Jake. listen to me.
- Come on. They're gonna put you out.

281
00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:41.460
- Norm. sit down.
- No. no. I gotta get out of these leads.

282
00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:43.130
God damn it! Bring them home!

283
00:21:43.210 --> 00:21:45.880
- Norm! Do not leave control!
- You're not ready for it!

284
00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:51.470
- Oh. come on. you ain't got no skills.
- So close!

285
00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:53.140
I don't even have to play defense on it.

286
00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:54.720
Hey. guys. Hey.

287
00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:57.140
- It's okay. I'll get him.
- Jake. you have to come back!

288
00:21:57.140 --> 00:21:58.980
Jake! Jake! Excuse me.

289
00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:03.150
- Watch it!
- Sorry!

290
00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:04.650
Come on!

291
00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:08.650
Jake! We're not supposed to be running!

292
00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:20.580
- Jeez! Sorry.
- Watch it!

293
00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:44.360
Hey. Marine!

294
00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:46.610
Damn.

295
00:22:48.650 --> 00:22:51.820
- Grace?
- Well. who'd you expect. numbnuts?

296
00:22:53.030 --> 00:22:54.580
Think fast.

297
00:22:55.370 --> 00:22:57.580
Motor control's looking good.

298
00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:11.800
Come on. everybody. quiet down! All right. gang. lights out.

299
00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:14.050
Come on. Louise. chop-chop.

300
00:23:14.050 --> 00:23:15.550
Hey. hey. hey!

301
00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:18.270
Don't play with that. you'll go blind.

302
00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:19.890
That's kind of freaky.

303
00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:22.390
Come on. Scat.

304
00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:24.730
Good night.

305
00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:29.570
Lights out! See you at dinner. kiddies.

306
00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:54.640
Welcome back.

307
00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:04.940
- You okay? You all right?
- Yeah. I'm okay.

308
00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:11.940
I'm Trudy. I fly all the science sorties. And this here is my baby.

309
00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:14.160
Hold on a second.

310
00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:17.620
Hey. Wainfleet! Get it done!

311
00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:22.160
- We bounce at zero-nine.
- Yeah. I'm on it. capitaine!

312
00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:24.830
Vine strike's still loose.

313
00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:27.170
You guys are packing some heavy gear.

314
00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:28.540
Watch it!

315
00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:31.840
Yeah. that's 'cause we're not the only thing flying around out there.

316
00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:33.670
Or the biggest.

317
00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:36.510
I'm gonna need you on a door gun. I'm a man short.

318
00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:38.430
I thought you'd never ask.

319
00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:42.930
There's your man. See you on the flight line.

320
00:24:53.650 --> 00:24:56.030
You wanted to see me. Colonel?

321
00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:58.740
This low gravity'll make you soft.

322
00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:01.700
You get soft.

323
00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:08.250
Pandora will shit you out dead with zero warning.

324
00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:11.880
I pulled your record. Corporal.

325
00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:14.380
Venezuela. that was some mean bush.

326
00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:18.680
Nothing like this here. though.

327
00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:24.350
You got some heart. kid. showing up in this neighborhood.

328
00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:26.270
I figured it's just another hellhole.

329
00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:28.770
I was First Recon myself.

330
00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:32.070
A few years ahead of you. Well. maybe more than a few.

331
00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:35.950
Three tours Nigeria. not a scratch.

332
00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:37.490
I come out here?

333
00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:41.530
Day one. Think I felt like a shavetail louie?

334
00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:46.210
Yeah. They could fix me up. if I rotated back.

335
00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:51.960
Yeah. and make me pretty again. But you know what? I kind of like it.

336
00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:54.880
It reminds me every day what's waiting out there.

337
00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:02.810
The Avatar Program is a bad joke. Bunch of limp-dick science majors.

338
00:26:02.890 --> 00:26:09.900
However. it does present an opportunity both timely and unique.

339
00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:11.560
- Clear!
- Clear!

340
00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:21.950
A recon gyrene in an avatar body. That's a potent mix.

341
00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:23.620
Give me the goose bumps.

342
00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:27.120
Such a Marine could provide the intel I need.

343
00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:28.910
right on the ground.

344
00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:32.130
Right in the hostiles' camp.

345
00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:38.260
Look. Sully. I want you to learn these savages from the inside.

346
00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:40.090
I want you to gain their trust.

347
00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:41.930
I need to know how to force their cooperation

348
00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:44.470
or hammer them hard if they won't.

349
00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:48.270
- Am I still with Augustine?
- On paper.

350
00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:52.440
Yeah. you walk like one of her science pukes. you quack like one.

351
00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:55.520
but you report to me.

352
00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:58.740
Can you do that for me. son?

353
00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:01.660
Hell. yeah. sir.

354
00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:04.370
Well. all right. then.

355
00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:18.340
Son. I take care of my own.

356
00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:19.470
You get me what I need.

357
00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:22.800
I'll see to it you get your legs back when you rotate home.

358
00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:25.180
Your real legs.

359
00:27:27.850 --> 00:27:29.980
That sounds real good. sir.

360
00:27:36.610 --> 00:27:39.320
- Link's ready!
- Phase-Iock 40%.

361
00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:43.030
Just keep your mouth shut and let Norm do the talking.

362
00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:46.660
I have five congruencies. Phase-Iock 90%.

363
00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:48.080
Link three ready.

364
00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:50.410
All right. I'm going in.

365
00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:24.570
Sturmbeest herd coming up on your right.

366
00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:26.450
Got it! Thanks.

367
00:28:27.450 --> 00:28:31.040
Looks like a bull. a dozen cows and some juveniles.

368
00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:21.500
Shut it down. We're gonna stay a while.

369
00:29:24.970 --> 00:29:28.760
- Norm! Your pack.
- Pack.

370
00:29:31.390 --> 00:29:35.390
Stay with the ship. One idiot with a gun is enough.

371
00:29:37.810 --> 00:29:39.480
You the man. Doc.

372
00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:19.190
Prolemuris. They're not aggressive.

373
00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:25.230
Relax. Marine. You're making me nervous.

374
00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:33.410
So. how will they know we're here?

375
00:30:33.450 --> 00:30:36.160
I'm sure they're watching us right now.

376
00:30:40.250 --> 00:30:42.250
This was our school.

377
00:30:42.290 --> 00:30:45.590
Now it's just... storage.

378
00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:48.340
The kids were so bright.

379
00:30:49.050 --> 00:30:50.260
Eager to learn.

380
00:30:50.430 --> 00:30:52.840
They picked up English faster than I could teach it.

381
00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:57.270
So. we'll take a couple of these Ph monitors...

382
00:30:57.560 --> 00:30:59.480
...and a soil probe.

383
00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:05.020
That little yellow case back there. The old microscope.

384
00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:07.150
Here.

385
00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:08.820
Oh. yeah. I love this one.

386
00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:11.030
The stingbats knocked them down.

387
00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:22.330
I keep hoping someone will come back in and read them.

388
00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:24.130
Why don't they come back?

389
00:31:26.050 --> 00:31:32.220
The Omaticaya... learned as much about us as they needed to.

390
00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:38.560
What happened here?

391
00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:45.520
Are you going to help us with this gear? We've got a lot to do.

392
00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:02.080
- Keep moving. Norm.
- Keep up. guys!

393
00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:08.090
- And here I go.
- Scanning.

394
00:32:10.510 --> 00:32:13.680
Wow! It's that fast?

395
00:32:15.930 --> 00:32:18.010
- Amazing. isn't it?
- Yeah.

396
00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:21.890
So. that is signal transduction from this root

397
00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:25.600
to the root of the tree next to it. So. we should take a sample.

398
00:32:25.690 --> 00:32:27.360
Okay. Sample.

399
00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:33.700
You know. it's probably electrical. based on the speed of the reaction.

400
00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:38.330
Norm. you've contaminated the sample with your saliva.

401
00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:40.580
Right.

402
00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:10.230
So. here I go.

403
00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:39.550
Don't shoot. Don't shoot. you'll piss him off.

404
00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:44.890
It's already pissed off.

405
00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:48.020
Jake. that armor's too thick. Trust me.

406
00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:57.950
It's a territorial threat display. Do not run. or he'll charge.

407
00:33:58.570 --> 00:34:00.370
So. what do I do. dance with it?

408
00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:03.910
Just hold your ground.

409
00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:21.390
Yeah? Come on! What you got?

410
00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:24.470
Oh. yeah. Who's bad? That's right.

411
00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:27.890
Yeah. that's what I'm talking about. bitch.

412
00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:32.020
That's right. get your punk ass back to mommy.

413
00:34:32.110 --> 00:34:35.030
Yeah? Yeah. you got nothing. You keep running.

414
00:34:35.110 --> 00:34:38.110
Yeah. and why don't you bring back some of your friends. huh?

415
00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:42.320
Oh. shit.

416
00:34:54.130 --> 00:34:56.630
So what about this one? Run? Don't run? What?

417
00:34:58.050 --> 00:35:00.090
Run! Definitely run!

418
00:38:46.570 --> 00:38:47.860
I'm gonna have to call it. guys.

419
00:38:47.950 --> 00:38:50.860
We're not allowed to run night ops. Colonel's orders.

420
00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:55.910
I'm sorry. Doc. he's just gonna have to hang on till morning.

421
00:38:55.910 --> 00:38:57.540
He won't make it till morning.

422
00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:52.400
I don't have all goddamn night.

423
00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:55.320
Come on! Come on!

424
00:42:09.270 --> 00:42:10.900
Hey. wait. Don't!

425
00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:15.530
Great.

426
00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:16.550
Look. I know you probably don't understand this.

427
00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:23.890
but thank you.

428
00:43:29.020 --> 00:43:30.480
Thank you.

429
00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:35.940
That was pretty impressive.

430
00:43:38.650 --> 00:43:41.610
I would have been screwed if you hadn't come along. It was...

431
00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:48.290
Hey. wait a second. Hey. where you going?

432
00:43:49.290 --> 00:43:50.750
Wait up!

433
00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:53.330
Just... Hey. slow down.

434
00:43:53.330 --> 00:43:56.420
Look. wait up. I just wanted to say thanks for killing those things.

435
00:43:57.500 --> 00:44:00.550
- Damn!
- Don't thank.

436
00:44:01.470 --> 00:44:03.840
You don't thank for this.

437
00:44:05.390 --> 00:44:09.350
This is sad. Very sad only.

438
00:44:10.270 --> 00:44:12.350
Okay. Okay. I'm sorry.

439
00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:15.020
Whatever I did. I am sorry.

440
00:44:18.530 --> 00:44:21.690
All this is your fault. They did not need to die.

441
00:44:22.530 --> 00:44:24.610
My fault? They attacked me. How am I the bad guy?

442
00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:26.370
Your fault!

443
00:44:26.830 --> 00:44:29.540
- Your fault!
- Easy. Easy.

444
00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:33.370
You're like a baby. Making noise. don't know what to do.

445
00:44:33.370 --> 00:44:34.870
Easy.

446
00:44:37.130 --> 00:44:39.550
Fine. Fine.

447
00:44:40.710 --> 00:44:42.840
If you love your little forest friends.

448
00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:46.220
why not let them just kill my ass?

449
00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:49.010
What's the thinking?

450
00:44:49.810 --> 00:44:52.520
- Why save you?
- Yeah. Yeah. why save me?

451
00:44:56.940 --> 00:44:58.900
You have a strong heart.

452
00:45:01.030 --> 00:45:02.240
No fear.

453
00:45:06.740 --> 00:45:09.620
But stupid! Ignorant like a child.

454
00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:18.460
Well. if I'm like a child. then...

455
00:45:19.130 --> 00:45:21.340
Look. maybe you should teach me.

456
00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:23.630
Sky People cannot learn. You do not See.

457
00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:25.630
Well. then teach me how to See.

458
00:45:25.630 --> 00:45:28.180
- No one can teach you to See.
- Whoa.

459
00:45:29.470 --> 00:45:31.930
Look. come on. can't we talk?

460
00:45:32.890 --> 00:45:36.770
Say. where'd you learn to speak English? Dr. Augustine's school?

461
00:45:41.610 --> 00:45:42.440
You're like a baby.

462
00:45:49.490 --> 00:45:51.120
I need your help.

463
00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:54.080
You should not be here.

464
00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.830
- Okay. take me with you.
- No! Go back.

465
00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:01.540
No.

466
00:46:03.050 --> 00:46:04.300
Go back.

467
00:46:25.900 --> 00:46:26.940
No!

468
00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:49.930
What...

469
00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:55.180
What are they?

470
00:46:56.520 --> 00:46:58.520
Seeds of the Sacred Tree.

471
00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:01.230
Very pure spirits.

472
00:47:25.340 --> 00:47:27.300
What was that all about?

473
00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:30.510
Come.

474
00:47:31.930 --> 00:47:33.050
Come!

475
00:47:35.220 --> 00:47:36.560
Where are we going?

476
00:47:47.070 --> 00:47:48.150
Come.

477
00:48:03.290 --> 00:48:05.040
What's your name?

478
00:48:05.130 --> 00:48:06.210
Shit!

479
00:48:31.700 --> 00:48:32.820
Okay.

480
00:48:35.530 --> 00:48:38.410
Calm people. calm.

481
00:48:44.170 --> 00:48:47.000
What are you doing. Tsu'tey?

482
00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:52.380
These demons are forbidden here.

483
00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:55.510
There has been a sign.

484
00:48:55.510 --> 00:48:57.850
This is a matter for the Tsahik.

485
00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:03.680
Bring him.

486
00:49:05.190 --> 00:49:06.770
What's going on?

487
00:49:09.110 --> 00:49:10.230
Wait.

488
00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:14.820
What's happening?

489
00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:16.700
Hey!

490
00:50:26.890 --> 00:50:28.230
Father...

491
00:50:29.060 --> 00:50:30.860
...I see you.

492
00:50:42.580 --> 00:50:43.990
This creature...

493
00:50:44.290 --> 00:50:47.370
...why do you bring him here?

494
00:50:48.830 --> 00:50:50.210
I was going to kill him...

495
00:50:50.500 --> 00:50:52.330
...but there was a sign from Eywa.

496
00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:54.590
I have said...

497
00:50:54.590 --> 00:50:57.260
...no dreamwalker will come here.

498
00:50:57.340 --> 00:50:58.670
What's he saying?

499
00:50:58.680 --> 00:51:01.510
His alien smell fills my nose.

500
00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:02.680
Hey. what's he saying?

501
00:51:02.680 --> 00:51:04.930
My father is deciding whether to kill you.

502
00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:09.520
Your father. It's nice to meet you. sir.

503
00:51:13.190 --> 00:51:14.690
Step back!

504
00:51:16.820 --> 00:51:20.240
I will look at this alien.

505
00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:21.660
That is Mother.

506
00:51:21.660 --> 00:51:25.660
She is Tsahik. The one who interprets the will of Eywa.

507
00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:27.870
Who's Eywa?

508
00:51:34.710 --> 00:51:36.460
What are you called?

509
00:51:37.380 --> 00:51:38.760
Jake Sully.

510
00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:51.480
- Why did you come to us?
- I came to learn.

511
00:51:52.850 --> 00:51:55.810
We have tried to teach other Sky People.

512
00:51:55.900 --> 00:51:59.240
It is hard to fill a cup which is already full.

513
00:52:00.740 --> 00:52:03.070
Well. my cup is empty. trust me.

514
00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:06.950
Just ask Dr. Augustine. I'm no scientist.

515
00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:08.490
What are you?

516
00:52:10.750 --> 00:52:13.960
I was a Marine. A...

517
00:52:14.830 --> 00:52:17.460
A warrior of the Jarhead clan.

518
00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:20.620
A warrior! I could kill him easily!

519
00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:22.130
No!

520
00:52:22.550 --> 00:52:26.760
This is the first warrior dreamwalker...

521
00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:28.720
...we have seen.

522
00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:31.600
We need to learn more about him.

523
00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:35.980
My Daughter...

524
00:52:35.980 --> 00:52:40.360
...you will teach him our way...

525
00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:43.820
...to speak and walk as we do.

526
00:52:43.820 --> 00:52:47.450
Why me? That's not fair...

527
00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:52.370
It is decided. My daughter will teach you our ways.

528
00:52:52.460 --> 00:52:56.040
Learn well. Jakesully.

529
00:52:56.840 --> 00:53:00.630
Then we will see if your insanity can be cured.

530
00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:20.820
Good evening.

531
00:53:23.860 --> 00:53:25.650
Please don't get up.

532
00:53:27.490 --> 00:53:28.820
Excuse me.

533
00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:32.330
Sorry.

534
00:53:35.420 --> 00:53:37.120
Hey. how you doing?

535
00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:46.720
Thank you.

536
00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:51.600
You know. I don't even know your name.

537
00:53:52.310 --> 00:53:54.730
Neytiri te Ckaha Mo'at'ite.

538
00:53:52.310 --> 00:53:54.730
Neytiri te Ckaha Mo'at'ite.

539
00:53:57.020 --> 00:53:58.940
Again. a whole lot slower?

540
00:53:58.980 --> 00:54:00.270
Neytiri.

541
00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:01.980
Neytili.

542
00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:04.280
Neytiri.

543
00:54:04.740 --> 00:54:06.650
Neytiri.

544
00:54:07.660 --> 00:54:09.660
It's nice to meet you. Neytiri.

545
00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:11.530
It's nice.

546
00:54:54.370 --> 00:54:56.660
- Jake. Jake!
- He's in alpha.

547
00:54:56.750 --> 00:54:59.790
- He's coming out right now.
- Jake. Jake!

548
00:55:01.580 --> 00:55:04.670
Come on back. kid. Come on. That's it.

549
00:55:06.340 --> 00:55:09.010
There you go. There you go. there you go.

550
00:55:09.090 --> 00:55:11.470
You're okay. You're okay.

551
00:55:11.550 --> 00:55:14.470
Damn! You were dug in like a tick.

552
00:55:17.560 --> 00:55:20.100
- Is the avatar safe?
- Yeah. Doc.

553
00:55:21.230 --> 00:55:23.940
And you are not gonna believe where I am.

554
00:55:24.940 --> 00:55:27.940
The last thing we see is this Marine's ass

555
00:55:28.030 --> 00:55:32.160
disappearing into the brush with this angry thanator coming after him.

556
00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:35.160
- Hey. it's not something you can teach.
- That is awesome.

557
00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:37.620
You know. for reasons I cannot fathom.

558
00:55:37.620 --> 00:55:40.960
the Omaticaya have chosen you. God help us all.

559
00:55:42.290 --> 00:55:43.790
"Jarhead clan"?

560
00:55:45.380 --> 00:55:48.420
- And it worked?
- Hey. I'm practically family.

561
00:55:49.510 --> 00:55:53.010
They're gonna study me. I have to learn to be one of them.

562
00:55:53.010 --> 00:55:54.680
That's called taking the initiative. son.

563
00:55:54.680 --> 00:55:57.220
- I wish I had 10 more like you.
- Look. Sully. Sully.

564
00:55:57.310 --> 00:56:00.730
Just find out what the blue monkeys want.

565
00:56:01.480 --> 00:56:07.320
You know. I mean. we try to give them medicine. education. roads.

566
00:56:07.320 --> 00:56:09.150
But no. no. no. they like mud.

567
00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:13.200
And that wouldn't bother me. it's just that they're...

568
00:56:13.780 --> 00:56:16.830
Hey. can you... Can somebody just... Sector 12.

569
00:56:18.620 --> 00:56:21.830
Okay. go. go. go. stop. Stop...

570
00:56:21.830 --> 00:56:24.040
Rich. stop! That's... Jesus!

571
00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:30.210
Their damn village happens to be resting on the richest unobtanium deposit

572
00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:35.590
within 200 klicks in any direction. I mean. look at all that cheddar!

573
00:56:39.350 --> 00:56:41.850
- Well. who gets them to move?
- Guess.

574
00:56:43.770 --> 00:56:47.310
- What if they won't go?
- I'm betting that they will.

575
00:56:47.820 --> 00:56:50.530
Okay. okay. okay. okay. hey. Look. Look.

576
00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:54.200
Killing the indigenous looks bad.

577
00:56:54.280 --> 00:56:58.030
but there's one thing that shareholders hate more than bad press.

578
00:56:58.120 --> 00:57:01.370
and that's a bad quarterly statement. I didn't make up the rules.

579
00:57:01.370 --> 00:57:04.580
So just find me a carrot that'll get them to move.

580
00:57:05.330 --> 00:57:08.420
otherwise it's gonna have to be all stick. Okay?

581
00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:12.710
You got three months. That's when the 'dozers get there.

582
00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:14.800
Well. we're wasting time.

583
00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:16.890
I like this guy.

584
00:57:17.050 --> 00:57:20.560
- Guys. right now...
- Okay. let's run through them again.

585
00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:22.890
Mo'at. Dragon lady.

586
00:57:24.940 --> 00:57:27.900
- Eytucan.
- Eytukan. He's the clan leader.

587
00:57:27.980 --> 00:57:31.150
But she's the spiritual leader. Like a shaman.

588
00:57:31.230 --> 00:57:32.820
Got it.

589
00:57:32.900 --> 00:57:35.110
- T'su'tey.
- Tsu'tey.

590
00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:37.910
- Tsu'tey.
- He'll be the next clan leader.

591
00:57:39.950 --> 00:57:42.410
- Neytiri.
- She'll be the next Tsahik.

592
00:57:42.500 --> 00:57:44.500
They become a mated pair.

593
00:57:45.500 --> 00:57:47.750
- So who's this Eywa?
- Who's Eywa?

594
00:57:48.670 --> 00:57:52.250
Only their deity. Their goddess. made up of all living things.

595
00:57:52.340 --> 00:57:53.710
Everything they know!

596
00:57:53.760 --> 00:57:55.880
You'd know this if you had any training whatsoever.

597
00:57:55.970 --> 00:57:57.340
Who's got a date with the chief's daughter?

598
00:57:57.390 --> 00:57:59.090
Come on. That's...

599
00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:01.760
Knock it off. It's like kindergarten around here.

600
00:58:03.850 --> 00:58:06.810
Neytiri was my best student.

601
00:58:06.890 --> 00:58:09.900
She and her sister. Sylwanin.

602
00:58:09.980 --> 00:58:12.400
Just amazing girls.

603
00:58:12.480 --> 00:58:14.070
I got a date with Sylwanin too.

604
00:58:14.990 --> 00:58:16.030
She's dead.

605
00:58:19.910 --> 00:58:22.450
Let's go. Village life starts early.

606
00:58:24.660 --> 00:58:27.160
Don't do anything unusually stupid.

607
00:58:46.350 --> 00:58:47.680
Easy. boy.

608
00:58:48.310 --> 00:58:50.400
Pale is female.

609
00:58:53.360 --> 00:58:55.780
Okay. Easy. girl.

610
00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:28.310
That is shahaylu. The bond.

611
00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:31.730
Feel her.

612
00:59:34.860 --> 00:59:38.990
Feel her heartbeat. Her breath.

613
00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:43.780
Feel her strong legs.

614
00:59:46.240 --> 00:59:48.580
You may tell her what to do.

615
00:59:48.660 --> 00:59:49.870
Inside.

616
00:59:50.830 --> 00:59:53.750
For now. say where to go.

617
00:59:56.750 --> 00:59:58.000
Forward!

618
01:00:15.610 --> 01:00:18.730
- You should go away.
- No. you'd miss me.

619
01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:22.450
I knew you could speak English.

620
01:00:25.030 --> 01:00:27.200
This alien will learn nothing...

621
01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:29.240
...a rock sees more...

622
01:00:29.620 --> 01:00:31.500
...look at him.

623
01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:41.840
Again.

624
01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:45.430
If you want to hit this thing. it's gonna be complicated.

625
01:00:45.430 --> 01:00:47.930
Your scan doesn't show the internal structure.

626
01:00:48.010 --> 01:00:50.140
There's an outer row of columns.

627
01:00:50.140 --> 01:00:52.980
Real heavy duty. There's a secondary ring here.

628
01:00:52.980 --> 01:00:56.610
and an inner ring. There's a core structure like a spiral.

629
01:00:57.480 --> 01:00:59.110
That's how they move up and down.

630
01:00:59.190 --> 01:01:02.110
We're gonna need accurate scans on every column.

631
01:01:02.110 --> 01:01:03.490
Roger that.

632
01:01:03.570 --> 01:01:06.280
What else can you tell us about the structure?

633
01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:09.120
I'm guessing this secondary ring. that's also load-bearing.

634
01:01:13.660 --> 01:01:17.130
- So where are we going?
- Getting out of Dodge.

635
01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:22.670
I'm not about to let Selfridge and Quaritch micro-manage this thing.

636
01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:26.010
There's a mobile link up at Site 26 we can work out of.

637
01:01:26.090 --> 01:01:28.050
way up in the mountains.

638
01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:31.180
The Hallelujah Mountains?

639
01:01:31.180 --> 01:01:33.480
- That's right.
- Are you serious?

640
01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:35.520
- Yeah.
- Yes!

641
01:01:38.980 --> 01:01:42.650
The legendary floating mountains of Pandora. Heard of them?

642
01:01:56.170 --> 01:01:58.040
We're getting close.

643
01:01:58.130 --> 01:02:00.840
Yeah. look at my instruments.

644
01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:03.880
Yep. We're in the Flux Vortex.

645
01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:06.220
We're VFR from here on.

646
01:02:06.220 --> 01:02:08.180
What's VFR?

647
01:02:08.180 --> 01:02:10.550
Means you gotta see where you're going.

648
01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:14.560
- You can't see anything.
- Exactly. Ain't that a bitch?

649
01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:35.700
Oh. my God.

650
01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:48.090
You should see your faces.

651
01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:17.540
Thank you for flying Air Pandora.

652
01:03:30.550 --> 01:03:33.260
So what does hold them up?

653
01:03:33.350 --> 01:03:34.800
Grace explained it to me.

654
01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:37.470
Some kind of maglev effect.

655
01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:41.390
Because unobtanium is a superconductor... or something.

656
01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:05.540
Welcome to camp.

657
01:04:09.380 --> 01:04:14.050
- So. this is my bunk.
- This stuff is nasty.

658
01:04:15.350 --> 01:04:17.390
- Norm. go under.
- All right.

659
01:04:17.470 --> 01:04:21.020
- Grace didn't miss a thing.
- Trudy. you'll take the top one.

660
01:04:21.020 --> 01:04:23.520
She knew I was talking to the Colonel.

661
01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:27.230
But I had what she needed. a way back in with the clan.

662
01:04:27.230 --> 01:04:28.860
so she's playing nice.

663
01:04:28.940 --> 01:04:34.030
All right. Jake. hang a left. You'll be in the link at the end.

664
01:04:36.910 --> 01:04:41.000
Unit one. Beulah. She's the least glitchy.

665
01:05:30.210 --> 01:05:31.550
Holy shit!

666
01:05:32.420 --> 01:05:34.340
Do not look in her eye.

667
01:05:42.890 --> 01:05:44.600
Ikran is not horse.

668
01:05:45.770 --> 01:05:47.600
Once shahaylu is made.

669
01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:55.820
ikran will fly with only one hunter in the whole life.

670
01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:08.500
To become taronyu. hunter.

671
01:06:08.580 --> 01:06:12.170
you must choose your own ikran and he must choose you.

672
01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:16.760
- When?
- When you are ready.

673
01:07:07.140 --> 01:07:10.310
Okay. This is video log 12.

674
01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:13.190
Time's 2132.

675
01:07:14.610 --> 01:07:18.030
Do I have to do this now? I really need to get some rack.

676
01:07:18.030 --> 01:07:20.910
No. now. When it's fresh.

677
01:07:23.530 --> 01:07:25.410
Okay. location. shack.

678
01:07:26.370 --> 01:07:28.710
and the days are starting to blur together.

679
01:07:30.830 --> 01:07:34.090
The language is a pain. but. you know.

680
01:07:34.090 --> 01:07:37.300
I figure it's like field-stripping a weapon. Just repetition. repetition.

681
01:07:37.380 --> 01:07:39.050
- Navi.
- "Nari."

682
01:07:39.050 --> 01:07:41.380
- Nari.
- "Narrri"!

683
01:07:41.390 --> 01:07:42.680
Narrri!

684
01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:45.640
Txurni'ul. Stronger.

685
01:07:50.230 --> 01:07:53.900
Neytiri calls me skxawng. It means moron.

686
01:07:56.230 --> 01:07:57.730
This is a very important part of it.

687
01:07:57.740 --> 01:07:59.940
- Norm's attitude has improved lately.
- I see you. I see you.

688
01:07:59.950 --> 01:08:02.410
But it's not just. "I'm seeing you in front of me."

689
01:08:02.410 --> 01:08:04.070
it's "I see into you. I See you."

690
01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:06.830
It's good he's back on board. but he thinks I'm a skxawng. too.

691
01:08:06.910 --> 01:08:09.160
"I'm accepting you. I understand you." So you gotta get this. okay?

692
01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:12.460
I gotta run! Okay? Let's go.

693
01:08:13.250 --> 01:08:16.840
My feet are getting tougher. I can run farther every day.

694
01:08:18.710 --> 01:08:21.840
I have to trust my body to know what to do.

695
01:08:26.930 --> 01:08:28.680
Yeah! Check it out!

696
01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:30.770
Oh. crap!

697
01:08:35.020 --> 01:08:39.940
Every day it's reading the trails. the tracks at the waterhole.

698
01:08:39.940 --> 01:08:42.200
the tiniest scents and sounds.

699
01:08:47.740 --> 01:08:52.540
She's always going on about the flow of energy. the spirits of animals.

700
01:08:53.290 --> 01:08:56.000
I really hope this tree-hugger crap isn't on the final.

701
01:08:56.090 --> 01:08:59.800
This isn't just about eye-hand coordination out there. you know.

702
01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:02.510
You need to listen to what she says.

703
01:09:02.590 --> 01:09:05.800
Try to see the forest through her eyes.

704
01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:08.430
Excuse me. This is my video log here.

705
01:09:23.820 --> 01:09:26.410
With Neytiri. it's learn fast or die.

706
01:09:27.660 --> 01:09:29.830
You gotta be kidding me.

707
01:09:58.860 --> 01:10:00.900
I talked Mo'at into letting Grace into the village.

708
01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:03.250
Look how big you are.

709
01:10:03.340 --> 01:10:04.650
It's the first time since her school was closed down.

710
01:10:04.740 --> 01:10:06.490
You are so pretty.

711
01:10:35.730 --> 01:10:37.310
Come on. Marine.

712
01:11:02.540 --> 01:11:05.250
I'm trying to understand this deep connection

713
01:11:05.340 --> 01:11:07.550
the people have to the forest.

714
01:11:08.010 --> 01:11:10.840
She talks about a network of energy

715
01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:14.260
that flows through all living things.

716
01:11:15.140 --> 01:11:18.480
She says all energy is only borrowed.

717
01:11:19.350 --> 01:11:21.980
and one day you have to give it back.

718
01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:05.520
You were in 16 hours today.

719
01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:10.400
You're still losing weight.

720
01:12:14.910 --> 01:12:16.580
No. you don't.

721
01:12:16.620 --> 01:12:19.370
- I gotta get some sleep.
- Come back here.

722
01:12:21.580 --> 01:12:23.040
Bon appetit.

723
01:12:25.420 --> 01:12:26.960
Today I made a kill.

724
01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:30.760
And we ate it. At least. I know where that meal came from.

725
01:12:31.090 --> 01:12:35.260
Other body. You need to take care of this body. Okay?

726
01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:37.050
- Get it? Let's eat it.
- Yeah. yeah.

727
01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:40.060
Here. I'll make it easy for you.

728
01:12:40.100 --> 01:12:42.350
Give it to me.

729
01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:43.940
- You look like crap.
- Thank you.

730
01:12:44.020 --> 01:12:45.770
You're burning way too hard.

731
01:12:46.860 --> 01:12:48.690
Get rid of this shit.

732
01:12:48.780 --> 01:12:50.690
And then you can lecture me.

733
01:12:51.780 --> 01:12:54.490
Now. I'm telling you. as your boss.

734
01:12:55.950 --> 01:12:59.290
and as someone who might even consider being a friend someday

735
01:12:59.370 --> 01:13:01.790
to take some down time.

736
01:13:01.870 --> 01:13:03.620
Eat this. please.

737
01:13:05.130 --> 01:13:08.380
Trust me. I... learned the hard way.

738
01:13:22.980 --> 01:13:25.560
What did happen at the school. Grace?

739
01:13:33.740 --> 01:13:39.370
Neytiri's sister. Sylwanin. stopped coming to school.

740
01:13:39.450 --> 01:13:41.490
She was angry about the clear-cutting.

741
01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:46.870
And one day. she and a couple of other young hunters came running in

742
01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:50.090
all painted up.

743
01:13:50.170 --> 01:13:52.800
They had set a bulldozer on fire.

744
01:13:56.130 --> 01:13:59.010
I guess they thought I could protect them.

745
01:14:01.810 --> 01:14:04.640
The troopers pursued them to the school.

746
01:14:05.810 --> 01:14:08.020
They killed Sylwanin in the doorway.

747
01:14:08.060 --> 01:14:10.400
Right in front of Neytiri.

748
01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:11.650
And then shot the others.

749
01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:15.950
I got most of the kids out.

750
01:14:19.990 --> 01:14:21.620
But they never came back.

751
01:14:25.460 --> 01:14:26.460
I'm sorry.

752
01:14:35.050 --> 01:14:38.840
A scientist stays objective.

753
01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:43.560
We can't be ruled by emotion.

754
01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:46.810
But I put 10 years of my life into that school.

755
01:14:47.810 --> 01:14:50.560
They called me sa'nok.

756
01:14:52.650 --> 01:14:53.650
Mother.

757
01:14:53.730 --> 01:14:54.730
Mother.

758
01:14:57.150 --> 01:15:01.570
That kind of pain reaches back through the link.

759
01:15:27.020 --> 01:15:28.140
I see you...

760
01:15:28.230 --> 01:15:29.440
...Brother

761
01:15:29.900 --> 01:15:32.100
...and thank you.

762
01:15:36.230 --> 01:15:38.110
Your spirit goes with Eywa.

763
01:15:38.650 --> 01:15:40.490
Your body stays behind...

764
01:15:40.780 --> 01:15:43.450
...to become part of The People.

765
01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:48.620
A clean kill.

766
01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:53.460
You are ready.

767
01:16:19.110 --> 01:16:22.490
Learning to ride an ikran. we call them banshees.

768
01:16:22.570 --> 01:16:25.160
is the test every young hunter has to pass.

769
01:16:27.370 --> 01:16:30.700
But to do that. you gotta go where the banshees are.

770
01:16:31.540 --> 01:16:32.750
Oo-rah.

771
01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:05.490
Now what?

772
01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:55.560
Jakesully will go first.

773
01:19:28.430 --> 01:19:32.430
Now you choose your ikran. This you must feel inside.

774
01:19:33.350 --> 01:19:36.310
If he also chooses you. move quick like I showed.

775
01:19:36.390 --> 01:19:39.270
You will have one chance. Jake.

776
01:19:39.270 --> 01:19:41.440
How will I know if he chooses me?

777
01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:43.480
He will try to kill you.

778
01:19:44.650 --> 01:19:46.070
Outstanding.

779
01:20:46.340 --> 01:20:47.750
Let's dance.

780
01:20:53.890 --> 01:20:55.760
That moron's going to die.

781
01:21:19.620 --> 01:21:21.580
Don't be afraid. warrior.

782
01:21:21.580 --> 01:21:23.080
Make the bond!

783
01:21:26.380 --> 01:21:27.420
No!

784
01:21:31.380 --> 01:21:32.510
Jake!

785
01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:48.150
Shahaylu. Jake.

786
01:21:50.530 --> 01:21:51.780
Shahaylu!

787
01:22:01.870 --> 01:22:03.000
Stop!

788
01:22:11.630 --> 01:22:16.720
Yeah. that's right. You're mine. Huh?

789
01:22:29.940 --> 01:22:32.900
First flight seals the bond. You cannot wait.

790
01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:36.570
- Think. "Fly!"
- Fly?

791
01:22:45.210 --> 01:22:46.460
God damn!

792
01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:52.130
Oh. shit!

793
01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:03.760
Shut up and fly straight!

794
01:23:14.030 --> 01:23:16.360
That's it. Bank left!

795
01:23:25.660 --> 01:23:27.450
Level out! That's it.

796
01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:34.290
Jakesully!

797
01:23:59.070 --> 01:24:00.150
Hey!

798
01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:07.490
Let's go!

799
01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:21.840
Yeah. baby. I got this!

800
01:24:22.680 --> 01:24:23.930
Oh. shit!

801
01:24:29.230 --> 01:24:32.980
I may not be much of a horse guy. but I was born to do this.

802
01:24:33.810 --> 01:24:34.900
Yeah!

803
01:24:35.860 --> 01:24:39.030
- I came like this. This you.
- Yeah. yeah.

804
01:24:39.030 --> 01:24:44.030
- I turn. I feel the wind. I turn very strong.
- Look. yeah. see. I banked so hard...

805
01:25:46.090 --> 01:25:48.100
The Tree of Souls.

806
01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:53.730
It's their most sacred place.

807
01:25:54.480 --> 01:25:57.310
See the Flux Vortex in these false color images?

808
01:25:57.400 --> 01:25:59.480
Yeah. that's what messes up my instruments.

809
01:25:59.570 --> 01:26:04.110
There is something really interesting going on in there biologically.

810
01:26:05.490 --> 01:26:07.570
I would die to get samples.

811
01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:10.990
Outsiders are strictly forbidden.

812
01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:12.410
You lucky swine.

813
01:27:33.780 --> 01:27:34.870
Hell. yeah!

814
01:27:34.950 --> 01:27:36.500
Hell. yeah!

815
01:27:49.300 --> 01:27:53.010
I was a stone-cold aerial hunter. Death from above.

816
01:27:54.350 --> 01:27:57.350
Only problem is. you're not the only one.

817
01:28:01.310 --> 01:28:02.400
Dive!

818
01:28:25.170 --> 01:28:26.380
Go. go!

819
01:28:34.550 --> 01:28:35.890
Follow me!

820
01:29:22.310 --> 01:29:24.940
Our guys call it a Great Leonopteryx.

821
01:29:25.810 --> 01:29:28.860
It is Toruk. Last Shadow.

822
01:29:30.610 --> 01:29:33.740
Yeah. right. It's the last one you ever see.

823
01:29:38.330 --> 01:29:42.120
My grandfather's grandfather was Toruk Macto.

824
01:29:42.790 --> 01:29:44.580
Rider of Last Shadow.

825
01:29:45.960 --> 01:29:47.420
He rode this?

826
01:29:49.050 --> 01:29:50.670
Toruk chose him.

827
01:29:51.010 --> 01:29:54.880
It has only happened five times since the time of the First Songs.

828
01:29:54.970 --> 01:29:56.970
- That's a long time.
- Yes.

829
01:29:57.680 --> 01:29:59.550
Toruk Macto was mighty.

830
01:30:01.390 --> 01:30:05.230
He brought the clans together in a time of great sorrow.

831
01:30:05.230 --> 01:30:07.560
All Na'vi people know the story.

832
01:30:14.280 --> 01:30:18.490
Everything is backwards now. Like out there is the true world

833
01:30:19.620 --> 01:30:21.620
and in here is the dream.

834
01:30:42.310 --> 01:30:45.020
It's hard to believe it's only been three months.

835
01:30:48.060 --> 01:30:50.520
I can barely remember my old life.

836
01:30:54.070 --> 01:30:55.900
I don't know who I am anymore.

837
01:31:14.670 --> 01:31:17.510
Haven't gotten lost in the woods. have you?

838
01:31:20.680 --> 01:31:23.600
Your last report was more than two weeks ago.

839
01:31:25.810 --> 01:31:28.310
I'm starting to doubt your resolve!

840
01:31:30.900 --> 01:31:33.480
The way I see it. it's time to terminate the mission.

841
01:31:33.480 --> 01:31:35.360
No. I can do this.

842
01:31:35.440 --> 01:31:37.070
You already have.

843
01:31:37.990 --> 01:31:40.280
You give me good. usable intel.

844
01:31:40.280 --> 01:31:42.490
This Tree of Souls place.

845
01:31:42.950 --> 01:31:46.330
Yeah. I got them by the balls with that when this turns into a shit fight

846
01:31:46.410 --> 01:31:48.160
which it will. Yeah.

847
01:31:49.120 --> 01:31:51.120
Now it's time to come in.

848
01:31:52.590 --> 01:31:54.460
By the way.

849
01:31:54.960 --> 01:31:56.960
you gonna get your legs back.

850
01:31:57.840 --> 01:32:01.510
Yeah. I got your corporate approval. It's a done deal.

851
01:32:01.510 --> 01:32:03.970
Gonna have you on a shuttle tonight.

852
01:32:04.050 --> 01:32:05.850
I'm a man of my word.

853
01:32:08.770 --> 01:32:10.520
I gotta finish this.

854
01:32:12.810 --> 01:32:14.360
There's one more thing.

855
01:32:15.070 --> 01:32:20.030
Ceremony. It's the final stage of becoming a man.

856
01:32:22.530 --> 01:32:24.660
If I do it. I'm one of them.

857
01:32:26.160 --> 01:32:27.950
And they'll trust me.

858
01:32:31.580 --> 01:32:34.790
And I can negotiate the terms of their relocation.

859
01:32:48.390 --> 01:32:50.890
Well. then. you'd better get it done. Corporal.

860
01:33:08.330 --> 01:33:12.330
The Na'vi say that every person is born twice.

861
01:33:14.330 --> 01:33:19.750
The second time is when you earn your place among The People forever.

862
01:33:25.260 --> 01:33:29.560
You are now a son of the Omaticaya.

863
01:33:30.770 --> 01:33:34.020
You are part of The People.

864
01:34:20.320 --> 01:34:22.320
Come. Come.

865
01:34:39.960 --> 01:34:42.670
This is a place for prayers to be heard.

866
01:34:44.300 --> 01:34:46.170
And sometimes answered.

867
01:34:54.020 --> 01:34:56.730
We call these trees Utraya Mokri.

868
01:34:57.730 --> 01:34:59.480
The Tree of Voices.

869
01:35:01.480 --> 01:35:03.650
The voices of our ancestors.

870
01:35:18.670 --> 01:35:20.250
I can hear them.

871
01:35:25.170 --> 01:35:26.800
They live. Jake.

872
01:35:28.840 --> 01:35:30.260
within Eywa.

873
01:35:34.430 --> 01:35:36.310
You are Omaticaya now.

874
01:35:37.020 --> 01:35:40.140
You may make your bow from the wood of Hometree.

875
01:35:45.650 --> 01:35:47.740
And you may choose a woman.

876
01:35:49.860 --> 01:35:51.820
We have many fine women.

877
01:35:53.030 --> 01:35:55.030
Ninat is the best singer.

878
01:35:57.910 --> 01:35:59.830
But I don't want Ninat.

879
01:36:04.130 --> 01:36:06.090
Beyral is a good hunter.

880
01:36:07.760 --> 01:36:09.840
Yeah. she is a good hunter.

881
01:36:11.930 --> 01:36:13.680
I've already chosen.

882
01:36:17.180 --> 01:36:19.680
But this woman must also choose me.

883
01:36:23.690 --> 01:36:25.310
She already has.

884
01:37:19.750 --> 01:37:21.700
I am with you now. Jake.

885
01:37:23.250 --> 01:37:25.120
We are mated for life.

886
01:37:31.420 --> 01:37:33.470
What the hell are you doing. Jake?

887
01:38:03.910 --> 01:38:05.040
Ma Jake!

888
01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:06.420
Don't forget your phase integration.

889
01:38:06.500 --> 01:38:07.830
- Jake!
- No. no. the middle button.

890
01:38:07.920 --> 01:38:09.840
- You gotta eat something.
- Yeah. there you go.

891
01:38:18.260 --> 01:38:23.220
Jake! Jake. Wake up! Jake. please!

892
01:38:23.850 --> 01:38:26.350
Don't make me force-feed a cripple.

893
01:38:27.520 --> 01:38:29.110
Grace. I don't want... Hey!

894
01:38:32.900 --> 01:38:34.030
Jake!

895
01:38:42.950 --> 01:38:44.040
Okay.

896
01:38:55.130 --> 01:38:57.220
Here. I'm done. Let's go.

897
01:38:57.220 --> 01:38:59.550
And when was the last time you took a shower?

898
01:38:59.550 --> 01:39:01.640
- I don't need a shower.
- Jesus. Marine.

899
01:39:05.770 --> 01:39:07.060
Jake!

900
01:39:13.820 --> 01:39:18.740
Jake! Wake up! Jake! Wake up!

901
01:39:22.240 --> 01:39:23.580
Hey!

902
01:39:24.240 --> 01:39:26.750
Stop! Stop!

903
01:39:26.750 --> 01:39:29.580
- Jake!
- Go back. stop!

904
01:39:33.750 --> 01:39:35.090
Hey. boss.

905
01:39:35.590 --> 01:39:36.760
Hey!

906
01:39:39.340 --> 01:39:40.430
- What?
- I got a native

907
01:39:40.510 --> 01:39:43.470
doing the funky chicken here. He's blocking my blade.

908
01:39:43.560 --> 01:39:46.680
Well. keep going. He'll move.

909
01:39:46.770 --> 01:39:50.020
These people have to learn that we don't stop. Come on. go. go. go.

910
01:39:52.360 --> 01:39:54.570
Stop! Hey!

911
01:39:54.650 --> 01:39:56.940
Go! Go!

912
01:39:57.950 --> 01:39:59.400
There. see? He moved.

913
01:40:11.790 --> 01:40:14.670
Dude. dude. Whoa. dude! Dude. no!

914
01:40:14.670 --> 01:40:15.670
I'm blind.

915
01:40:27.600 --> 01:40:29.850
- Jake!
- Neytiri!

916
01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:33.100
Here. come on!

917
01:40:58.010 --> 01:41:00.590
Freeze it right there.

918
01:41:02.180 --> 01:41:04.640
Scale up. Enhance.

919
01:41:06.260 --> 01:41:07.810
Son of a bitch.

920
01:41:09.310 --> 01:41:10.770
Unbelievable.

921
01:41:11.850 --> 01:41:13.980
- Get me a pilot.
- Yes. sir.

922
01:41:20.780 --> 01:41:22.950
Tsu'tey will lead the war party.

923
01:41:29.540 --> 01:41:30.830
Stop please!

924
01:41:32.330 --> 01:41:34.460
This will only make it worse.

925
01:41:34.580 --> 01:41:36.250
You do not speak here!

926
01:41:37.420 --> 01:41:39.210
We will strike them in the heart.

927
01:41:47.010 --> 01:41:49.180
Tsu'tey! Don't do this.

928
01:41:52.310 --> 01:41:53.850
- You!
- Listen. Brother...

929
01:41:59.320 --> 01:42:02.490
- You mated with this woman?
- Oh. shit.

930
01:42:03.740 --> 01:42:05.740
Is this true?

931
01:42:07.240 --> 01:42:10.450
We are mated before Eywa. It is done.

932
01:42:11.830 --> 01:42:13.000
Brother. please.

933
01:42:13.080 --> 01:42:16.920
Do not attack the Sky People. Many Omaticaya will die if you do.

934
01:42:16.920 --> 01:42:19.250
You are not my brother!

935
01:42:22.420 --> 01:42:24.220
And I am not your enemy!

936
01:42:25.840 --> 01:42:28.720
The enemy is out there. and they are very powerful!

937
01:42:30.970 --> 01:42:32.770
Go! Go! Go!

938
01:42:35.980 --> 01:42:38.480
- I can talk to them.
- No more talk.

939
01:42:38.480 --> 01:42:39.900
Tsu'tey!

940
01:42:46.110 --> 01:42:49.030
I am Omaticaya. I am one of you.

941
01:42:49.830 --> 01:42:52.080
And I have the right to speak.

942
01:42:56.710 --> 01:42:58.580
I have something to say...

943
01:43:00.920 --> 01:43:02.380
...to all of you.

944
01:43:06.420 --> 01:43:08.510
The words are like stones in my heart.

945
01:43:12.850 --> 01:43:14.850
Sir. I'm sorry. No. no. no! Hold on!

946
01:43:14.850 --> 01:43:17.140
You can't interrupt a link in progress!

947
01:43:18.310 --> 01:43:19.650
It's very dangerous!

948
01:43:22.270 --> 01:43:23.440
Grace!

949
01:43:24.650 --> 01:43:25.860
Oh. no.

950
01:43:26.070 --> 01:43:28.070
- Wait!
- Stay down. sir.

951
01:43:29.570 --> 01:43:31.820
Okay. Look...

952
01:43:32.910 --> 01:43:34.240
I was sent here to...

953
01:43:37.870 --> 01:43:39.290
You see?

954
01:43:39.460 --> 01:43:41.920
It is a demon in a false body.

955
01:44:01.810 --> 01:44:05.190
- Are you out of your goddamn mind?
- You crossed the line.

956
01:44:08.650 --> 01:44:10.820
Wheel this meat out of here.

957
01:44:12.530 --> 01:44:15.080
Jake! What the hell is going on here?

958
01:44:18.330 --> 01:44:20.120
You let me down. son.

959
01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:23.380
So. what.

960
01:44:24.880 --> 01:44:26.920
you find yourself some local tail

961
01:44:26.920 --> 01:44:30.130
and you just completely forget what team you're playing for?

962
01:44:30.220 --> 01:44:32.720
Parker. there is time to salvage the situation.

963
01:44:32.800 --> 01:44:35.390
- Parker...
- Shut your pie hole!

964
01:44:35.390 --> 01:44:39.600
Or what. Ranger Rick? You gonna shoot me?

965
01:44:39.680 --> 01:44:42.440
- I could do that.
- You need to muzzle your dog.

966
01:44:42.520 --> 01:44:45.270
Yeah. can we just take this down a couple of notches. please?

967
01:44:45.360 --> 01:44:47.900
You say you want to keep your people alive?

968
01:44:47.900 --> 01:44:49.940
You start by listening to her.

969
01:44:50.030 --> 01:44:52.320
Those trees were sacred to the Omaticaya

970
01:44:52.410 --> 01:44:54.240
- in a way you can't imagine.
- You know what?

971
01:44:54.240 --> 01:44:56.620
You throw a stick in the air around here.

972
01:44:56.620 --> 01:44:59.620
it's gonna land on some sacred fern.

973
01:44:59.700 --> 01:45:01.120
- for Christ's sake!
- I'm not talking

974
01:45:01.120 --> 01:45:05.630
about some kind of pagan voodoo here. I'm talking about something real.

975
01:45:05.630 --> 01:45:07.800
something measurable in the biology of the forest.

976
01:45:07.800 --> 01:45:08.300
Something measurable in the biology of the forest.

977
01:45:08.380 --> 01:45:09.880
Which is what. exactly?

978
01:45:10.920 --> 01:45:12.300
What we think we know

979
01:45:12.300 --> 01:45:15.760
is that there is some kind of electrochemical communication

980
01:45:15.760 --> 01:45:20.180
between the roots of the trees. like the synapses between neurons.

981
01:45:20.270 --> 01:45:24.850
And each tree has ten-to-the-fourth connections to the trees around it.

982
01:45:24.940 --> 01:45:28.110
And there are ten-to-the-twelfth trees on Pandora.

983
01:45:28.980 --> 01:45:31.320
Which is a lot. I'm guessing.

984
01:45:31.320 --> 01:45:33.740
It's more connections than the human brain.

985
01:45:34.910 --> 01:45:37.490
Get it? It's a network.

986
01:45:37.490 --> 01:45:40.540
It's a global network. and the Na'vi can access it.

987
01:45:40.620 --> 01:45:44.160
They can upload and download data. Memories.

988
01:45:44.170 --> 01:45:46.920
At sites like the one you just destroyed.

989
01:45:47.500 --> 01:45:48.590
Yes!

990
01:45:49.800 --> 01:45:53.920
What the hell have you people been smoking out there?

991
01:45:54.550 --> 01:45:56.640
They're just goddamn trees!

992
01:45:58.390 --> 01:46:01.180
- You need to wake up. Parker.
- No. You need to wake up.

993
01:46:01.180 --> 01:46:05.690
The wealth of this world isn't in the ground. It's all around us.

994
01:46:05.770 --> 01:46:09.480
The Na'vi know that. and they are fighting to defend it.

995
01:46:09.570 --> 01:46:13.860
If you want to share this world with them. you need to understand them.

996
01:46:13.950 --> 01:46:18.660
I'd say we understand them just fine. thanks to Jake here.

997
01:46:20.370 --> 01:46:22.830
Hey. Doc. come take a look.

998
01:46:22.910 --> 01:46:25.160
They're not gonna give up their home.

999
01:46:26.960 --> 01:46:28.630
They're not gonna make a deal.

1000
01:46:29.670 --> 01:46:31.960
For what? Lite beer?

1001
01:46:32.550 --> 01:46:34.090
And blue jeans?

1002
01:46:37.340 --> 01:46:40.220
There's nothing that we have that they want.

1003
01:46:42.140 --> 01:46:45.180
Everything they sent me out here to do is a waste of time.

1004
01:46:50.110 --> 01:46:51.520
They're never gonna leave Hometree.

1005
01:46:54.400 --> 01:47:00.410
So. since a deal can't be made. I guess things get real simple.

1006
01:47:00.620 --> 01:47:05.120
Jake. thanks. I'm getting all emotional.

1007
01:47:05.160 --> 01:47:07.790
I might just give you a big wet kiss.

1008
01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:35.190
Talk to me. Lyle.

1009
01:47:35.530 --> 01:47:38.070
It looks like they hit it with banshees first.

1010
01:47:38.200 --> 01:47:39.860
See the angle's steep?

1011
01:47:44.120 --> 01:47:46.120
They set the ampsuit on fire.

1012
01:47:46.500 --> 01:47:47.700
Driver's toast.

1013
01:47:49.210 --> 01:47:50.960
The rest of the squad?

1014
01:47:52.130 --> 01:47:55.050
Six bodies. That's all of them.

1015
01:47:56.510 --> 01:47:57.710
The equipment's totaled.

1016
01:48:00.550 --> 01:48:03.010
Jesus Christ.

1017
01:48:06.180 --> 01:48:09.560
I'll do it with minimal casualties to the indigenous.

1018
01:48:10.440 --> 01:48:12.940
I'll drive them out with gas first.

1019
01:48:14.190 --> 01:48:15.770
It'll be humane.

1020
01:48:17.400 --> 01:48:18.860
More or less.

1021
01:48:20.570 --> 01:48:22.410
All right. let's pull the trigger.

1022
01:48:25.870 --> 01:48:28.250
Come on. people. Let's get it packed. let's go.

1023
01:48:28.580 --> 01:48:31.750
You know. they never even wanted us to succeed.

1024
01:48:32.580 --> 01:48:38.130
They bulldozed a sacred site on purpose to trigger a response.

1025
01:48:38.210 --> 01:48:40.920
Just fabricating this war to get what they want.

1026
01:48:41.510 --> 01:48:43.390
This is how it's done.

1027
01:48:46.180 --> 01:48:49.480
When people are sitting on shit that you want.

1028
01:48:49.560 --> 01:48:53.600
you make them your enemy. Then you're justified in taking it.

1029
01:48:53.690 --> 01:48:56.980
Quaritch is rolling the gunships. He's gonna hit Hometree.

1030
01:48:57.070 --> 01:48:58.070
My God.

1031
01:49:04.530 --> 01:49:08.790
- Dr. Augustine! You cannot be up here!
- Back off!

1032
01:49:08.790 --> 01:49:12.580
Parker. Wait. Stop. These are people you're about to...

1033
01:49:12.580 --> 01:49:13.750
- No. No. no. no. no.
- I said back off!

1034
01:49:13.750 --> 01:49:17.250
They're fly-bitten savages that live in a tree!

1035
01:49:17.250 --> 01:49:18.960
All right? Look around!

1036
01:49:19.050 --> 01:49:22.760
I don't know about you. but I see a lot of trees! They can move!

1037
01:49:22.840 --> 01:49:24.300
- Can you guys just please...
- Yes. sir.

1038
01:49:24.390 --> 01:49:26.970
There are families in there. There are children. Babies.

1039
01:49:26.970 --> 01:49:28.260
Are you gonna kill children?

1040
01:49:28.350 --> 01:49:32.270
You don't want that kind of blood on your hands. Believe me.

1041
01:49:32.350 --> 01:49:34.770
Just let me try to talk them out.

1042
01:49:35.560 --> 01:49:37.060
They trust me.

1043
01:49:40.320 --> 01:49:42.820
Calibrate fast. We're going in. right now.

1044
01:49:42.820 --> 01:49:44.820
Calibrating three and four.

1045
01:49:44.820 --> 01:49:47.780
- Run sequence.
- Initiating. Thirty seconds.

1046
01:49:52.160 --> 01:49:53.960
Listen to me. You've got one hour.

1047
01:49:53.960 --> 01:49:56.630
Unless you want your girlfriend in there when the ax comes down.

1048
01:49:56.630 --> 01:49:59.290
you get them to evacuate. One hour.

1049
01:50:05.340 --> 01:50:06.470
Father!

1050
01:50:06.640 --> 01:50:07.680
Mother!

1051
01:50:07.680 --> 01:50:10.930
Eytukan. I have something to say.

1052
01:50:11.020 --> 01:50:12.430
Listen!

1053
01:50:13.480 --> 01:50:14.940
Speak. Jakesully.

1054
01:50:16.310 --> 01:50:19.270
A great evil is upon us...

1055
01:50:19.610 --> 01:50:21.480
The Sky People are coming...

1056
01:50:21.730 --> 01:50:24.240
...to destroy Hometree.

1057
01:50:26.700 --> 01:50:28.160
Look. tell them they're gonna be here soon.

1058
01:50:30.700 --> 01:50:33.540
You have to leave. or you're gonna die.

1059
01:50:33.540 --> 01:50:35.500
Are you certain of this?

1060
01:50:39.290 --> 01:50:43.010
Look. they sent me here to learn your ways

1061
01:50:44.170 --> 01:50:47.470
so one day I could bring this message and that you would believe it.

1062
01:50:50.010 --> 01:50:53.640
What are you saying. Jake? You knew this would happen?

1063
01:50:56.850 --> 01:50:58.400
Yes.

1064
01:50:58.400 --> 01:51:00.860
Look. at first it was just orders.

1065
01:51:02.360 --> 01:51:04.740
and then everything changed.

1066
01:51:04.740 --> 01:51:06.530
Okay? I fell in love.

1067
01:51:07.200 --> 01:51:12.490
I fell in love with the forest and with the Omaticaya people.

1068
01:51:13.660 --> 01:51:15.120
And with you.

1069
01:51:16.080 --> 01:51:17.910
- I trusted you.
- With you. With you.

1070
01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.880
- I trusted you!
- Trust me now. please.

1071
01:51:28.220 --> 01:51:30.720
You will never be one of The People!

1072
01:51:30.720 --> 01:51:32.600
- I shouldn't have...
- We tried to stop them!

1073
01:51:32.600 --> 01:51:34.640
Neytiri. please! Please.

1074
01:51:39.560 --> 01:51:40.730
Bind them.

1075
01:51:42.360 --> 01:51:43.480
Leave now!

1076
01:51:43.650 --> 01:51:46.990
You have to go. They're coming!

1077
01:52:00.830 --> 01:52:03.090
Time on target. one mike.

1078
01:52:03.090 --> 01:52:05.130
Copy. We have a visual.

1079
01:52:05.130 --> 01:52:08.170
Roger that. Stay on heading 030.

1080
01:52:08.260 --> 01:52:09.590
Roger. 030.

1081
01:52:23.400 --> 01:52:25.440
- Run to the forest!
- They're coming!

1082
01:52:27.070 --> 01:52:30.900
- They will destroy this place.
- Neytiri. you must go now!

1083
01:52:34.660 --> 01:52:36.950
Run to the forest! Run!

1084
01:52:39.330 --> 01:52:40.660
Run! Run!

1085
01:52:40.670 --> 01:52:44.330
Have no fear.

1086
01:53:01.190 --> 01:53:04.940
No! God damn it. run!

1087
01:53:05.150 --> 01:53:06.690
Take the ikran...

1088
01:53:06.690 --> 01:53:08.280
...attack from above.

1089
01:53:12.530 --> 01:53:14.740
That is one big damn tree.

1090
01:53:22.250 --> 01:53:26.460
Well. well. well. I'd say diplomacy has failed.

1091
01:53:28.420 --> 01:53:30.510
All right. people. let's get this done!

1092
01:53:30.590 --> 01:53:33.510
I want every gas round you got right in the front door.

1093
01:53:33.510 --> 01:53:35.550
Roger. CS.40's going hot.

1094
01:53:35.930 --> 01:53:37.140
- Fire.
- Firing.

1095
01:53:48.570 --> 01:53:50.610
Bingo. Mighty good shooting. ace.

1096
01:53:58.530 --> 01:54:00.200
Sir. they've opened fire.

1097
01:54:02.080 --> 01:54:03.830
You've got to be kidding me!

1098
01:54:16.390 --> 01:54:18.890
These dumb bastards ain't getting the message.

1099
01:54:18.970 --> 01:54:20.720
All right. let's turn up the heat.

1100
01:54:20.720 --> 01:54:23.730
- Switch incendiaries!
- Switching incendiaries.

1101
01:54:23.730 --> 01:54:24.850
Fire.

1102
01:54:28.150 --> 01:54:29.230
No!

1103
01:54:42.450 --> 01:54:44.200
Get everyone to the forest.

1104
01:54:47.580 --> 01:54:49.790
And that's how you scatter the roaches.

1105
01:54:53.550 --> 01:54:54.760
Neytiri!

1106
01:55:03.430 --> 01:55:06.480
We gotta move! He's gonna blow the columns!

1107
01:55:06.560 --> 01:55:07.850
My God!

1108
01:55:26.410 --> 01:55:29.790
- Mo'at! No!
- Lf you are one of us.

1109
01:55:31.290 --> 01:55:32.630
help us.

1110
01:55:40.390 --> 01:55:42.390
All call signs. switch missiles.

1111
01:55:42.560 --> 01:55:44.970
Give me HE's at the base of the west columns.

1112
01:55:46.930 --> 01:55:48.180
This way!

1113
01:55:49.310 --> 01:55:51.190
Rider section. switch missiles.

1114
01:55:51.270 --> 01:55:53.230
- One's good.
- Two's rocks up.

1115
01:55:53.320 --> 01:55:55.860
- Three's up.
- Yeah. baby. get some!

1116
01:55:56.400 --> 01:55:58.650
Charlie Oscar. Gunrunner standing by.

1117
01:55:58.740 --> 01:56:00.160
- Bring it down.
- Cleared hot.

1118
01:56:07.200 --> 01:56:08.790
Come on. Grace. move!

1119
01:56:11.420 --> 01:56:13.000
Down! Head down!

1120
01:56:15.590 --> 01:56:17.840
Come on. come on! Down!

1121
01:56:22.600 --> 01:56:24.600
- Solid hits.
- Solid rocks on target.

1122
01:56:24.680 --> 01:56:25.850
Screw this.

1123
01:56:27.100 --> 01:56:29.100
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

1124
01:56:29.190 --> 01:56:30.980
I didn't sign up for this shit!

1125
01:56:40.660 --> 01:56:42.530
Repeat. Ripple fire.

1126
01:57:26.080 --> 01:57:27.620
Go! Go! Go!

1127
01:58:00.740 --> 01:58:03.190
No. no. get back! Back!

1128
01:58:22.210 --> 01:58:24.800
Come on! Come on. move! Move!

1129
01:59:09.800 --> 01:59:13.430
That's good work. people. First round's on me tonight.

1130
01:59:14.100 --> 01:59:15.350
Let's boogie.

1131
01:59:15.770 --> 01:59:18.190
Dragon coming left. heading home.

1132
01:59:18.650 --> 01:59:20.560
Gunrunner coming left.

1133
01:59:20.650 --> 01:59:23.190
- Thunder copies.
- Rider section copies.

1134
01:59:30.780 --> 01:59:31.870
Father!

1135
01:59:47.720 --> 01:59:49.050
Daughter...

1136
01:59:50.220 --> 01:59:53.300
take... my... bow.

1137
01:59:57.430 --> 02:00:01.900
Protect The People.

1138
02:00:10.280 --> 02:00:11.530
Neytiri!

1139
02:00:21.580 --> 02:00:25.300
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Get away.

1140
02:00:25.960 --> 02:00:27.260
Get away!

1141
02:00:28.340 --> 02:00:30.090
Get away from here!

1142
02:00:31.550 --> 02:00:33.140
Never come back!

1143
02:00:50.820 --> 02:00:51.950
Pull the plug.

1144
02:00:52.950 --> 02:00:55.620
- No. you can't do that!
- You can't do that!

1145
02:00:55.620 --> 02:00:57.620
- Calm down! Calm down!
- No! Please!

1146
02:01:13.800 --> 02:01:16.350
I was a warrior who dreamed he could bring peace.

1147
02:01:17.770 --> 02:01:21.640
Sooner or later. though. you always have to wake up.

1148
02:01:24.480 --> 02:01:25.940
Let's go!

1149
02:01:33.780 --> 02:01:35.370
Put him down!

1150
02:01:38.740 --> 02:01:41.500
You murderer!

1151
02:02:28.130 --> 02:02:30.210
What's going on. brother? Long time no see.

1152
02:02:30.300 --> 02:02:31.380
Hey.

1153
02:02:32.720 --> 02:02:35.430
Personally. I don't feel these tree-hugging traitors deserve steak.

1154
02:02:35.510 --> 02:02:38.890
They get steak? That's bullshit. Let me see that.

1155
02:02:39.890 --> 02:02:42.430
Yeah. You know what that is. Down.

1156
02:02:42.520 --> 02:02:45.060
- Trudy!
- All the way down.

1157
02:02:48.440 --> 02:02:49.690
Max!

1158
02:02:59.740 --> 02:03:02.240
Trudy. fire up the ship! Go!

1159
02:03:02.830 --> 02:03:03.910
Here.

1160
02:03:16.010 --> 02:03:18.470
- Clear. Come on.
- Here you go.

1161
02:03:34.030 --> 02:03:37.990
Max. stay here. I need someone on the inside I can trust.

1162
02:03:37.990 --> 02:03:39.280
Okay. Go.

1163
02:03:53.090 --> 02:03:54.250
Clear.

1164
02:03:56.220 --> 02:03:57.510
Come on. baby.

1165
02:03:57.510 --> 02:04:00.300
Colonel? Sir? I got a situation here.

1166
02:04:03.930 --> 02:04:06.970
It's Samson 1-6. Unauthorized engine start.

1167
02:04:10.020 --> 02:04:11.310
Three!

1168
02:04:14.150 --> 02:04:15.360
Come on!

1169
02:04:17.320 --> 02:04:18.650
Mask on!

1170
02:04:21.240 --> 02:04:23.070
Gas. gas. gas!

1171
02:04:24.700 --> 02:04:26.740
I'm taking fire! Let's go!

1172
02:04:29.210 --> 02:04:32.330
Grab my hand! Come on. we're in. Let's go!

1173
02:04:33.340 --> 02:04:35.170
Come on. let's go! Let's go. go!

1174
02:04:47.810 --> 02:04:49.140
Colonel!

1175
02:04:55.860 --> 02:04:59.400
- Yeah! Yeah!
- All right! Yes!

1176
02:05:02.610 --> 02:05:05.280
- Crap.
- Everybody all right back there?

1177
02:05:05.370 --> 02:05:06.910
Oh. yeah. baby!

1178
02:05:06.910 --> 02:05:08.830
- Norm. you good?
- Yeah!

1179
02:05:09.710 --> 02:05:12.040
This is gonna ruin my whole day.

1180
02:05:12.290 --> 02:05:14.080
- Grace is hit!
- What?

1181
02:05:15.210 --> 02:05:16.880
- Get the trauma kit.
- Trauma kit!

1182
02:05:16.880 --> 02:05:20.380
- Keep the pressure on. Grace.
- Trauma kit's forward. on the bulkhead.

1183
02:05:20.470 --> 02:05:24.970
- Hang on. Grace.
- Doesn't matter. It's fine.

1184
02:05:28.310 --> 02:05:30.770
- You're good to go.
- Take it up!

1185
02:05:31.940 --> 02:05:33.770
Hold on. I'm pulling pitch.

1186
02:05:38.190 --> 02:05:39.650
You're clear!

1187
02:05:47.580 --> 02:05:50.330
Just keep going north. Get us deep in the mountains.

1188
02:05:50.410 --> 02:05:51.830
Copy that.

1189
02:05:58.800 --> 02:06:02.090
- Norm. you all good up there?
- Yep! Still here.

1190
02:06:03.970 --> 02:06:08.640
Well. at least they can't track us up here. Not this far into the Vortex.

1191
02:06:08.720 --> 02:06:10.770
It's strongest at the Tree of Souls. right?

1192
02:06:10.850 --> 02:06:12.350
Yeah.

1193
02:06:12.430 --> 02:06:14.390
Good. 'Cause that's where we're going.

1194
02:06:23.240 --> 02:06:24.400
Ouch.

1195
02:06:27.780 --> 02:06:29.240
You big baby.

1196
02:06:30.580 --> 02:06:32.040
We're moving.

1197
02:06:32.580 --> 02:06:34.620
I'm gonna get you some help. Grace.

1198
02:06:35.580 --> 02:06:37.750
I'm a scientist. remember?

1199
02:06:38.670 --> 02:06:41.130
I don't believe in fairy tales.

1200
02:06:41.960 --> 02:06:43.880
The People can help you.

1201
02:06:44.340 --> 02:06:45.630
I know it.

1202
02:06:47.640 --> 02:06:49.510
Why would they help us?

1203
02:07:05.530 --> 02:07:08.660
The People say Eywa will provide.

1204
02:07:10.580 --> 02:07:13.290
With no home. no hope.

1205
02:07:14.330 --> 02:07:16.500
there was only one place they could go.

1206
02:07:30.930 --> 02:07:32.140
Link's running.

1207
02:07:32.850 --> 02:07:35.850
- What's the plan here. Jake?
- There's no plan.

1208
02:07:36.890 --> 02:07:41.560
Tsu'tey is Olo'eyktan now. He's not gonna let you near that place.

1209
02:07:42.520 --> 02:07:43.940
I gotta try.

1210
02:07:46.700 --> 02:07:48.030
Launching.

1211
02:08:09.510 --> 02:08:10.720
Outcast.

1212
02:08:11.510 --> 02:08:12.760
Betrayer.

1213
02:08:13.850 --> 02:08:15.010
Alien.

1214
02:08:16.560 --> 02:08:19.270
I was in the place the eye does not see.

1215
02:08:30.450 --> 02:08:34.330
I needed their help. and they needed mine.

1216
02:08:35.240 --> 02:08:37.290
But to ever face them again.

1217
02:08:37.290 --> 02:08:39.790
I was gonna have to take it to a whole new level.

1218
02:08:48.340 --> 02:08:51.680
Sometimes your whole life boils down to one insane move.

1219
02:08:54.430 --> 02:08:56.810
There's something we gotta do.

1220
02:08:56.890 --> 02:08:58.600
You're not gonna like it.

1221
02:09:08.610 --> 02:09:12.490
The way I had it figured. Toruk is the baddest cat in the sky.

1222
02:09:12.490 --> 02:09:14.160
Nothing attacks him.

1223
02:09:14.660 --> 02:09:15.990
Easy. boy.

1224
02:09:16.450 --> 02:09:18.290
So why would he ever look up?

1225
02:09:19.410 --> 02:09:21.040
But that was just a theory.

1226
02:10:31.740 --> 02:10:33.360
Toruk Macto?

1227
02:11:13.150 --> 02:11:14.650
I See you.

1228
02:11:17.740 --> 02:11:19.070
I See you.

1229
02:11:27.370 --> 02:11:29.080
I was afraid. Jake.

1230
02:11:30.500 --> 02:11:32.000
For my people.

1231
02:11:35.050 --> 02:11:36.670
I'm not anymore.

1232
02:11:46.100 --> 02:11:48.440
Tsu'tey. son of Ateyo...

1233
02:11:49.060 --> 02:11:51.110
...I stand before you...

1234
02:11:52.110 --> 02:11:55.280
...ready to serve the Omaticaya people.

1235
02:11:57.860 --> 02:12:02.120
You are Olo'eyktan. and you are a great warrior.

1236
02:12:03.290 --> 02:12:05.450
I can't do this without you.

1237
02:12:12.500 --> 02:12:13.920
Toruk Macto.

1238
02:12:21.760 --> 02:12:23.510
I will fly with you.

1239
02:12:26.810 --> 02:12:28.560
My friend is dying.

1240
02:12:30.940 --> 02:12:32.480
Grace is dying.

1241
02:12:34.480 --> 02:12:36.320
I beg the help of Eywa.

1242
02:12:48.250 --> 02:12:50.250
Look where we are. Grace.

1243
02:12:56.960 --> 02:12:59.340
I need to take some samples.

1244
02:13:22.780 --> 02:13:26.870
The Great Mother may choose to save all that she is

1245
02:13:28.080 --> 02:13:29.540
in this body.

1246
02:13:32.080 --> 02:13:33.750
Is that possible?

1247
02:13:33.830 --> 02:13:38.340
She must pass through the eye of Eywa and return.

1248
02:13:39.590 --> 02:13:41.130
But. Jakesully.

1249
02:13:42.130 --> 02:13:43.760
she is very weak.

1250
02:13:45.220 --> 02:13:48.060
Hang on. Grace. They're gonna fix you up.

1251
02:13:51.230 --> 02:13:53.850
Hear us please. All Mother.

1252
02:13:54.400 --> 02:13:56.730
Eywa. help her.

1253
02:13:57.400 --> 02:13:59.610
Take this spirit into you...

1254
02:14:03.150 --> 02:14:05.410
...and breathe her back to us.

1255
02:14:09.200 --> 02:14:10.870
Let her walk among us...

1256
02:14:13.370 --> 02:14:15.330
...as one of The People.

1257
02:14:44.280 --> 02:14:45.360
Jake.

1258
02:14:47.780 --> 02:14:48.950
Grace.

1259
02:14:51.080 --> 02:14:52.790
I'm with her. Jake.

1260
02:14:54.790 --> 02:14:56.170
She's real!

1261
02:14:59.210 --> 02:15:02.380
Grace? Grace. please. Grace!

1262
02:15:03.550 --> 02:15:05.170
What's happening?

1263
02:15:06.130 --> 02:15:07.800
What's happening?

1264
02:15:12.140 --> 02:15:13.310
Grace!

1265
02:15:14.020 --> 02:15:15.180
Grace!

1266
02:15:17.270 --> 02:15:18.900
What's happening?

1267
02:15:25.150 --> 02:15:26.570
Did it work?

1268
02:15:32.240 --> 02:15:36.330
Her wounds were too great. It was not enough time.

1269
02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:39.750
She is with Eywa now.

1270
02:16:13.540 --> 02:16:16.200
With your permission. I will speak now.

1271
02:16:18.580 --> 02:16:21.040
You would honor me by translating.

1272
02:16:28.130 --> 02:16:30.340
The Sky People have sent us a message

1273
02:16:33.720 --> 02:16:36.140
that they can take whatever they want

1274
02:16:37.930 --> 02:16:39.730
and no one can stop them.

1275
02:16:43.310 --> 02:16:45.110
Well. we will send them a message.

1276
02:16:47.740 --> 02:16:50.070
You ride out as fast as the wind can carry you.

1277
02:16:53.370 --> 02:16:55.740
You tell the other clans to come.

1278
02:16:58.870 --> 02:17:01.370
You tell them Toruk Macto calls to them.

1279
02:17:03.590 --> 02:17:06.380
And you fly now with me!

1280
02:17:07.420 --> 02:17:09.920
My brothers! Sisters!

1281
02:17:11.010 --> 02:17:13.090
And we will show the Sky People

1282
02:17:14.100 --> 02:17:15.970
that they cannot take whatever they want.

1283
02:17:17.470 --> 02:17:18.930
and that this.

1284
02:17:19.640 --> 02:17:20.680
this is our land!

1285
02:17:27.780 --> 02:17:29.230
Yah!

1286
02:17:44.330 --> 02:17:45.750
Yah!

1287
02:18:15.160 --> 02:18:16.530
Yah!

1288
02:18:34.050 --> 02:18:35.550
We rode out to the four winds.

1289
02:18:38.300 --> 02:18:40.720
To the horse clans of the plain.

1290
02:18:43.690 --> 02:18:44.730
Back to the stars!

1291
02:18:44.810 --> 02:18:47.060
To the ikran people ofthe Eastern Sea.

1292
02:18:47.060 --> 02:18:48.360
For our children's children!

1293
02:18:48.440 --> 02:18:51.020
When Toruk Macto called them. they came.

1294
02:18:54.860 --> 02:18:56.240
Yah!

1295
02:19:32.400 --> 02:19:34.900
Everyone on this base. every one of you.

1296
02:19:34.990 --> 02:19:36.820
is fighting for survival.

1297
02:19:36.900 --> 02:19:38.410
That's a fact!

1298
02:19:39.240 --> 02:19:42.990
There's an aboriginal horde out there massing for an attack.

1299
02:19:44.080 --> 02:19:47.960
Now. these orbital images tell me

1300
02:19:48.370 --> 02:19:51.630
that the hostiles' numbers have gone from a few hundred

1301
02:19:51.630 --> 02:19:54.210
to well over 2.000 in one day.

1302
02:19:54.760 --> 02:19:56.760
And more are pouring in.

1303
02:19:59.220 --> 02:20:02.640
In a week's time. there could be 20.000 of them.

1304
02:20:02.720 --> 02:20:05.100
At that point. they will overrun our perimeter.

1305
02:20:05.100 --> 02:20:07.350
Well. that's not gonna happen!

1306
02:20:08.940 --> 02:20:12.610
Our only security lies in pre-emptive attack.

1307
02:20:12.610 --> 02:20:15.030
We will fight terror with terror.

1308
02:20:19.320 --> 02:20:23.490
Now. the hostiles believe that this mountain stronghold of theirs

1309
02:20:23.580 --> 02:20:25.990
is protected by their...

1310
02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:27.410
Their deity.

1311
02:20:28.710 --> 02:20:30.830
And when we destroy it.

1312
02:20:30.830 --> 02:20:33.210
we will blast a crater in their racial memory so deep

1313
02:20:33.290 --> 02:20:36.800
that they won't come within 1.000 klicks of this place ever again.

1314
02:20:36.880 --> 02:20:39.590
And that. too. is a fact.

1315
02:20:40.300 --> 02:20:42.050
Yeah! Yeah.

1316
02:20:52.520 --> 02:20:56.480
Jake. it's crazy here. It's full mobilization. They're rigging the shuttle as a bomber.

1317
02:20:56.570 --> 02:20:58.820
They've got these huge pallets of mine explosives.

1318
02:20:58.900 --> 02:21:01.820
It's for some kind of shock-and-awe campaign.

1319
02:21:01.910 --> 02:21:03.820
Fricking daisy cutters!

1320
02:21:05.330 --> 02:21:08.160
Quaritch has taken over. He's rolling. and there's no stopping him.

1321
02:21:08.250 --> 02:21:10.330
- When?
- 0600 tomorrow.

1322
02:21:10.420 --> 02:21:12.290
- Max! Max!
- I gotta go.

1323
02:21:14.170 --> 02:21:15.670
We're screwed!

1324
02:21:17.130 --> 02:21:19.380
And I was hoping for some sort of tactical plan

1325
02:21:19.380 --> 02:21:21.630
that didn't involve martyrdom.

1326
02:21:23.090 --> 02:21:26.470
We're going up against gunships with bows and arrows.

1327
02:21:29.480 --> 02:21:31.520
I have 15 clans out there.

1328
02:21:32.190 --> 02:21:34.310
That's over 2.000 warriors.

1329
02:21:35.820 --> 02:21:40.280
Now. we know these mountains. We fly them. You fly them. They don't.

1330
02:21:41.320 --> 02:21:45.370
Their instruments won't work up here. Missile tracking won't work.

1331
02:21:45.870 --> 02:21:47.370
They'll have to fire a line of sight.

1332
02:21:47.450 --> 02:21:51.710
If they bring the fight to us. then we have the home-field advantage.

1333
02:21:53.580 --> 02:21:57.040
You know he's gonna commit that bomber straight to the Tree of Souls.

1334
02:21:57.130 --> 02:21:58.380
Yeah. I know.

1335
02:21:58.380 --> 02:22:00.920
If they get to the Tree of Souls. it's over.

1336
02:22:01.010 --> 02:22:04.220
That's their direct line to Eywa. their ancestors.

1337
02:22:05.010 --> 02:22:07.050
It'll destroy them.

1338
02:22:07.050 --> 02:22:09.510
Then I guess we'd better stop him.

1339
02:22:24.570 --> 02:22:27.570
I'm probably just talking to a tree right now.

1340
02:22:29.990 --> 02:22:34.750
But if you're there. I need to give you a heads-up.

1341
02:22:37.290 --> 02:22:41.710
If Grace is with you. look into her memories.

1342
02:22:42.970 --> 02:22:45.090
See the world we come from.

1343
02:22:46.180 --> 02:22:48.090
There's no green there.

1344
02:22:49.470 --> 02:22:51.470
They killed their Mother.

1345
02:22:52.270 --> 02:22:54.770
And they're gonna do the same here.

1346
02:22:56.400 --> 02:22:58.980
More Sky People are gonna come.

1347
02:22:59.070 --> 02:23:02.110
They're gonna come like a rain that never ends.

1348
02:23:03.400 --> 02:23:05.150
Unless we stop them.

1349
02:23:07.740 --> 02:23:10.830
Look. you chose me for something.

1350
02:23:12.290 --> 02:23:14.160
I will stand and fight.

1351
02:23:15.210 --> 02:23:16.790
You know I will.

1352
02:23:19.290 --> 02:23:21.550
But I need a little help here.

1353
02:23:27.680 --> 02:23:30.720
Our Great Mother does not take sides. Jake.

1354
02:23:32.520 --> 02:23:35.980
She protects only the balance of life.

1355
02:23:47.780 --> 02:23:49.490
It was worth a try.

1356
02:24:20.190 --> 02:24:22.230
Yeah! Yeah! That's what I'm talking about!

1357
02:24:22.230 --> 02:24:25.610
Yeah! Yeah! That's what I'm talking about. man!

1358
02:24:37.710 --> 02:24:41.080
This is Group Leader. We are entering the Flux Vortex.

1359
02:24:41.460 --> 02:24:45.050
- Switch to manual flight mode.
- Copy. Manual flight mode.

1360
02:25:19.960 --> 02:25:21.830
This is Papa Dragon.

1361
02:25:21.920 --> 02:25:25.000
I want this mission high and tight. I want to be home for dinner.

1362
02:25:32.510 --> 02:25:36.260
- Suit Team. go.
- All right. ladies. let's bring the pain!

1363
02:25:46.820 --> 02:25:48.440
Move. move. move!

1364
02:25:54.070 --> 02:25:55.870
Bravo 1-1. move left.

1365
02:25:56.410 --> 02:25:59.830
Bravo 1-1 moving left. Watch flank.

1366
02:26:02.160 --> 02:26:05.790
- Watch formation. Keep moving.
- Roger that.

1367
02:26:05.790 --> 02:26:08.210
Charlie 2-1. watch your spacing.

1368
02:26:08.300 --> 02:26:09.670
Copy that. Over.

1369
02:26:09.670 --> 02:26:14.380
Eyes up. Check that overhead. And watch those thermal scans.

1370
02:26:14.970 --> 02:26:18.350
All call signs. Papa has lead. pushing to target.

1371
02:26:18.350 --> 02:26:20.810
Escorts. stay close on my shuttle.

1372
02:26:25.900 --> 02:26:28.440
We are gonna lose some paint in here.

1373
02:26:29.400 --> 02:26:32.030
Gun crews. keep your head on a swivel.

1374
02:26:32.150 --> 02:26:35.070
Make no mistake. people. they're out there.

1375
02:26:36.660 --> 02:26:39.910
All right. people. target in sight. Range. four klicks.

1376
02:26:39.990 --> 02:26:42.200
Valkyrie 1-6. get your payload ready.

1377
02:26:42.330 --> 02:26:44.830
- Copy. Prepare to offload.
- Staff Sergeant. stage the weapon.

1378
02:26:45.620 --> 02:26:47.830
Roll it to the ramp! Let's go!

1379
02:26:50.090 --> 02:26:51.170
Hold!

1380
02:26:59.180 --> 02:27:01.220
Charlie 2-1. got big movement.

1381
02:27:01.310 --> 02:27:02.720
- Hold position.
- Hold up. hold up.

1382
02:27:02.810 --> 02:27:06.980
- We got movement out there. 500 meters.
- Charlie 2-1. hold position.

1383
02:27:13.070 --> 02:27:16.070
Sir. ground has movement! Fast approaching.

1384
02:27:16.070 --> 02:27:18.660
- Charlie Oscar. Rider section.
- Firing line!

1385
02:27:19.030 --> 02:27:21.740
Targets closing. Range. 400 meters.

1386
02:27:22.450 --> 02:27:25.210
- Can't you clean it up?
- No. sir. It's the Flux.

1387
02:27:53.480 --> 02:27:56.150
Brother. I'm gonna punch a hole. You follow me through.

1388
02:28:37.900 --> 02:28:40.660
All aircraft. weapons free! Weapons free!

1389
02:28:41.780 --> 02:28:42.990
Break right. Come around.

1390
02:28:46.540 --> 02:28:48.040
Light them up!

1391
02:28:55.670 --> 02:28:57.880
Break formation. engage all hostiles.

1392
02:29:05.140 --> 02:29:07.020
Yeah! Get some!

1393
02:29:46.010 --> 02:29:47.850
Scorpions. pursue and destroy.

1394
02:29:58.690 --> 02:30:00.490
Jake! Jake! You copy?

1395
02:30:01.150 --> 02:30:03.860
We're falling back! We're getting hammered!

1396
02:30:03.860 --> 02:30:04.860
Copy. Get out of there.

1397
02:30:10.040 --> 02:30:11.450
That's him. Get after him!

1398
02:30:28.390 --> 02:30:29.890
Take him out!

1399
02:30:38.190 --> 02:30:39.650
Light her up!

1400
02:30:48.660 --> 02:30:50.080
Right there!

1401
02:30:50.200 --> 02:30:52.450
You're not the only one with a gun. bitch.

1402
02:30:52.710 --> 02:30:54.410
- Keep her in your sights.
- Purging. Feeding the leak.

1403
02:30:54.420 --> 02:30:55.500
Arming all pods.

1404
02:31:01.210 --> 02:31:02.300
That's it!

1405
02:31:32.950 --> 02:31:34.080
Seyzey!

1406
02:32:38.020 --> 02:32:40.190
Rogue One is hit. I'm going in.

1407
02:32:41.150 --> 02:32:42.560
Sorry. Jake.

1408
02:32:59.580 --> 02:33:00.670
Fire.

1409
02:33:18.770 --> 02:33:21.270
Tsu'tey! Brother. do you read?

1410
02:33:24.110 --> 02:33:25.770
Rogue One. you copy?

1411
02:33:27.780 --> 02:33:28.940
Trudy!

1412
02:33:39.830 --> 02:33:41.120
Time to target. two minutes.

1413
02:33:41.460 --> 02:33:43.880
Valkyrie 1-6. you are cleared and hot.

1414
02:33:43.960 --> 02:33:46.130
Copy. Dragon. We are starting our bomb run.

1415
02:33:51.970 --> 02:33:55.800
- Arm number one!
- Number one armed!

1416
02:33:57.180 --> 02:33:58.430
Ma Jake!

1417
02:34:00.350 --> 02:34:01.520
I read you.

1418
02:34:10.650 --> 02:34:12.650
- Neytiri!
- Seyzey's dead.

1419
02:34:13.240 --> 02:34:15.740
They are very close. They are many.

1420
02:34:17.160 --> 02:34:18.660
Do not attack.

1421
02:34:19.240 --> 02:34:21.200
Do you read me. Neytiri?

1422
02:34:23.790 --> 02:34:25.080
Do not attack!

1423
02:34:25.420 --> 02:34:28.590
Fall back now. Get out of there! That's an order!

1424
02:34:36.680 --> 02:34:37.890
Neytiri!

1425
02:34:39.970 --> 02:34:41.890
I got movement. I got movement.

1426
02:34:41.980 --> 02:34:44.230
Hold position. Something's coming.

1427
02:34:44.310 --> 02:34:46.100
Bravo 1-1. I got a big seating. Turn screens over.

1428
02:34:46.190 --> 02:34:48.400
- We got movement 200 meters.
- Hold your formation.

1429
02:34:48.400 --> 02:34:50.150
- Be ready.
- Watch your flanks.

1430
02:34:55.280 --> 02:34:56.780
Hundred meters and closing fast.

1431
02:35:13.340 --> 02:35:14.920
We gotta get out of here!

1432
02:35:22.720 --> 02:35:24.430
- Fall back! Fall back!
- Move! Move! Move!

1433
02:35:24.520 --> 02:35:26.940
Fall back! On the run! On the run!

1434
02:35:34.070 --> 02:35:36.740
Jake. Eywa has heard you.

1435
02:35:43.660 --> 02:35:45.450
Eywa has heard you!

1436
02:35:56.010 --> 02:35:57.430
Come on!

1437
02:36:09.690 --> 02:36:11.560
Fall back! Move! Move!

1438
02:36:36.050 --> 02:36:38.760
Sir! All escorts are down or falling back.

1439
02:36:38.760 --> 02:36:42.890
Let's get this done. Valkyrie 1-6. this is Dragon.

1440
02:36:42.970 --> 02:36:45.890
- Press to target.
- Copy. Pressing to target.

1441
02:36:45.890 --> 02:36:47.930
Stand by to drop. 30 seconds.

1442
02:37:07.750 --> 02:37:10.250
On my mark. Two. one. mark.

1443
02:37:10.250 --> 02:37:12.580
Drop! Drop! Drop! Go. go. go. go!

1444
02:37:12.580 --> 02:37:13.000
Drop! Drop! Drop! Go. go. go. go!

1445
02:37:46.740 --> 02:37:47.910
Brace!

1446
02:38:04.930 --> 02:38:06.300
It's Sully.

1447
02:38:19.990 --> 02:38:22.280
- Mask on!
- Breach alarm!

1448
02:41:06.650 --> 02:41:08.530
Come on. Come to papa.

1449
02:41:35.970 --> 02:41:37.770
Give it up. Quaritch!

1450
02:41:40.810 --> 02:41:42.310
It's all over.

1451
02:41:43.560 --> 02:41:46.110
Nothing's over while I'm breathing.

1452
02:41:46.110 --> 02:41:48.400
I kind of hoped you'd say that.

1453
02:42:44.540 --> 02:42:45.790
Come on!

1454
02:43:01.640 --> 02:43:05.770
Hey. Sully. how's it feel to betray your own race?

1455
02:43:10.400 --> 02:43:12.610
You think you're one of them?

1456
02:43:13.820 --> 02:43:15.490
Time to wake up.

1457
02:44:59.680 --> 02:45:00.760
Jake?

1458
02:45:14.440 --> 02:45:15.570
Jake.

1459
02:45:33.540 --> 02:45:34.960
Jake.

1460
02:45:50.980 --> 02:45:52.980
Jake! Ma Jake!

1461
02:46:34.650 --> 02:46:35.980
I See you.

1462
02:46:41.570 --> 02:46:42.900
I See you.

1463
02:47:08.010 --> 02:47:09.220
I See you. Brother.

1464
02:47:10.430 --> 02:47:11.640
Are The People safe?

1465
02:47:14.480 --> 02:47:15.600
They're safe.

1466
02:47:22.110 --> 02:47:23.610
I can't...

1467
02:47:24.780 --> 02:47:27.030
I cannot lead The People.

1468
02:47:27.570 --> 02:47:29.910
You must lead them... Jakesully.

1469
02:47:31.290 --> 02:47:33.200
I'm not officer material.

1470
02:47:33.290 --> 02:47:35.040
It is decided.

1471
02:47:38.380 --> 02:47:39.580
Now...

1472
02:47:40.800 --> 02:47:43.210
...do the duty of Olo'eyktan.

1473
02:47:47.800 --> 02:47:49.470
I will not kill you.

1474
02:47:49.510 --> 02:47:51.140
It is the way!

1475
02:47:53.470 --> 02:47:55.060
And it is good.

1476
02:47:57.310 --> 02:47:59.150
I will be remembered.

1477
02:48:01.770 --> 02:48:05.820
I fought... with Toruk Macto!

1478
02:48:08.320 --> 02:48:10.200
And we were brothers.

1479
02:48:11.620 --> 02:48:15.700
And he... was my last shadow.

1480
02:49:02.130 --> 02:49:04.960
The aliens went back to their dying world.

1481
02:49:07.130 --> 02:49:10.050
Only a few were chosen to stay.

1482
02:49:22.270 --> 02:49:24.810
The time of great sorrow was ending.

1483
02:49:26.860 --> 02:49:29.280
Toruk Macto was no longerneeded.

1484
02:49:41.830 --> 02:49:45.710
Well. I guess this is my last video log.

1485
02:49:47.550 --> 02:49:51.380
'Cause whatever happens tonight. either way. I'm...

1486
02:49:52.390 --> 02:49:55.220
I'm not gonna be coming back to this place.

1487
02:49:58.850 --> 02:50:00.980
Well. I guess I'd better go.

1488
02:50:03.560 --> 02:50:06.610
Yeah. I don't want to be late for my own party.

1489
02:50:09.940 --> 02:50:12.400
Yeah. it's my birthday. after all.

1490
02:50:14.910 --> 02:50:17.240
This is Jake Sully signing off.

1491
02:51:49.200 --> 02:51:52.420
Walking through a dream

1492
02:51:52.420 --> 02:51:55.950
I see you

1493
02:51:55.950 --> 02:52:02.500
My light in darkness breathing hope of new life

1494
02:52:02.500 --> 02:52:06.840
Now I live through you and you through me

1495
02:52:06.840 --> 02:52:10.060
Enchanting

1496
02:52:10.060 --> 02:52:17.870
I pray in my heart that this dream never end

1497
02:52:18.130 --> 02:52:26.760
I see me through your eyes

1498
02:52:26.760 --> 02:52:35.050

Your life shines the way into paradise

1500
02:52:42.060 --> 02:52:45.760
So I offer my life

1501
02:52:45.760 --> 02:52:51.110
I offer my love. for you

1502
02:52:51.450 --> 02:52:54.600
When my heart was never open

1503
02:52:54.600 --> 02:52:57.740
And my spirit never free

1504
02:52:57.740 --> 02:53:04.920
To the world that you have shown me

1505
02:53:04.920 --> 02:53:09.960
But my eyes could not division

1506
02:53:09.960 --> 02:53:18.830
All the colours of love and of life ever more

1507
02:53:18.830 --> 02:53:26.670
Evermore(I see me through your eyes)

1508
02:53:26.670 --> 02:53:33.150
I see me through your eyes(Living through life flying high)

1509
02:53:33.150 --> 02:53:36.740
Flying high

1510
02:53:36.740 --> 02:53:43.580
Your love shines the way into paradise

1511
02:53:43.580 --> 02:53:50.660
So I offer my life as a sacrifice

1512
02:53:50.660 --> 02:53:57.880
And live through your love

1513
02:53:57.880 --> 02:54:08.080
And live through your life

1514
